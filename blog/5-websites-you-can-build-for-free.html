      <p>You don't need to know how to code. You don't need to pay for hosting. You just need a couple of hours, Claude Code, and a free GitHub account.</p>

      <p>Here are five real website ideas you can build and put live on the internet this weekend. Every single one of them costs $0 to host.</p>

      <h2>1. A Portfolio Site for Your Work</h2>

      <p>Whether you're a photographer, designer, writer, consultant, or contractor — a portfolio site is the single best thing you can put online. It's your digital business card, except it actually shows your work.</p>

      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A hero section with your name and what you do</li>
        <li>A gallery or grid of your best work (6-12 pieces)</li>
        <li>A short about section — who you are, who you work with</li>
        <li>A contact form or just your email</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The prompt to get started:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Build me a portfolio website for a freelance photographer. Dark, minimal design. Include a photo gallery grid, about section, and contact form. Make it mobile responsive.</code></pre>

      <p>Swap "photographer" for whatever you do. Claude Code builds the whole thing. You replace the placeholder images with your actual work and push it live.</p>

      <h2>2. A Landing Page for Your Side Project</h2>

      <p>Got an idea for an app, a product, a newsletter, or a service? A landing page is how you test demand before building anything. Put it up, share it, see if people care.</p>

      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A headline that explains what you're offering in one sentence</li>
        <li>3-4 benefit bullets</li>
        <li>An email signup form (use Kit or Formspree for the backend)</li>
        <li>Social proof if you have any (testimonials, numbers)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The prompt:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Build a landing page for a meal prep delivery service called "FreshBox." Include a hero section with headline and email signup, features section with 3 benefits, how it works section, and a pricing section. Modern, clean design.</code></pre>

      <p>Even if FreshBox doesn't exist yet, you now have a live page collecting emails from people who want it. That's validation.</p>

      <h2>3. A Restaurant or Caf&eacute; Website</h2>

      <p>If you own or know someone who owns a restaurant, caf&eacute;, or bar — they probably need a better website. Most restaurant sites are either terrible or powered by a $30/month Squarespace subscription.</p>

      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hours and location (with Google Maps embed)</li>
        <li>The menu (a clean, readable HTML menu beats a PDF every time)</li>
        <li>Photos of the food and space</li>
        <li>A reservation link or phone number</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The prompt:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Build a website for a coffee shop called "Morning Ritual" in Montreal. Include the menu with prices, location with opening hours, a photo gallery, and a warm modern design with earth tones.</code></pre>

      <p>This is the kind of site that a restaurant would pay $1,500-3,000 for. You just built it for free.</p>

      <h2>4. A Personal Blog</h2>

      <p>You don't need WordPress to blog. You don't need Substack. A simple static blog hosted for free on GitHub Pages works perfectly.</p>

      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A blog index page listing your posts</li>
        <li>Individual post pages with clean, readable typography</li>
        <li>An about page</li>
        <li>An email signup form if you want to build a list</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The prompt:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Build a minimal personal blog. Dark theme, clean typography. Include a homepage that lists blog posts with titles and dates, individual post pages, and an about page. Make it feel like a premium reading experience.</code></pre>

      <p>When you want to write a new post, just tell Claude Code to create one. Push to GitHub. It's live. No login screens, no dashboards, no plugins.</p>

      <h2>5. A Small Business Website</h2>

      <p>This is the big one. Whether it's a plumber, a salon, a yoga studio, a law firm, or a landscaping company — every local business needs a website. Most are paying too much for one that doesn't even load fast on mobile.</p>

      <p><strong>What to include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Homepage with what you do and why people should pick you</li>
        <li>Services page with descriptions and pricing</li>
        <li>About page with your story</li>
        <li>Contact page with a form, phone number, and map</li>
        <li>Testimonials if you have them</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The prompt:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Build a professional website for a residential landscaping company called "GreenSpace Landscaping" in Toronto. Services include lawn care, garden design, and seasonal maintenance. Include a homepage, services page with pricing, gallery of past work, and contact page. Professional green and white color scheme.</code></pre>

      <p>This is literally what businesses pay thousands for. And you can build it, host it, and hand it over in an afternoon.</p>

      <h2>The Process Is the Same Every Time</h2>

      <p>For all five of these:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open your terminal</li>
        <li>Create a project folder</li>
        <li>Run <code>claude</code> and describe what you want</li>
        <li>Review the result, ask for changes</li>
        <li>Push to GitHub, turn on Pages</li>
        <li>Your site is live</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Total time: 1-3 hours depending on complexity. Total hosting cost: $0. Forever.</p>

      <p>Pick one and build it this weekend. Once you've done it once, you'll want to build more.</p>
