      <p>The biggest lie in the startup world is that you need "capital" to start. You don't. You need ideas, execution, and a stack of tools that don't charge you until you're making money.</p>

      <p>In 2026, the cost of software has bifurcated. Enterprise tools are getting more expensive, but the "indie stack" has become incredibly powerful and, often, completely free.</p>

      <p>Here is the exact tech stack I use to run my business with <strong>$0 in monthly fixed costs</strong>.</p>

      <h2>1. Hosting & Deployment: GitHub Pages</h2>

      <p>Stop paying $20/month for Webflow or $15/month for Squarespace. Unless you are a massive e-commerce operation, you do not need a CMS.</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> <a href="what-is-github-pages.html">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

      <p>It hosts your static HTML/CSS/JS files for free. It comes with a free SSL certificate. It's fast because it's served via a global CDN. And it scales infinitely.</p>

      <p>I build my sites using Claude Code (more on that in <a href="claude-code-vs-web-developer.html">this post</a>), push the code to a private GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages publishes it to the web instantly.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month.</p>

      <h2>2. Payments: Stripe</h2>

      <p>You need to get paid. Stripe is the standard for a reason. It handles credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and even international currencies.</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> Stripe.</p>

      <p>Stripe has no monthly fees. They only make money when you make money (roughly 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction). This is perfect for a lean startup. If you make $0 one month, you pay $0. If you make $10,000, paying them $300 is a bargain for the infrastructure they provide.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month (pay as you go).</p>

      <h2>3. Marketing & Email: Kit (formerly ConvertKit)</h2>

      <p>Social media algorithms are fickle (more on taming them in my <a href="viral-content-machine-google-pomeli.html">viral content guide</a>). An email list is the only audience you actually own.</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> Kit.</p>

      <p>Kit's free plan lets you have up to 10,000 subscribers. That is an insane amount of value. You can build landing pages, send broadcasts, and even sell digital products directly. By the time you have more than 10k subscribers, paying for the service will be a non-issue.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month (up to 10k subscribers).</p>

      <h2>4. Operations & Docs: Google Apps</h2>

      <p>You don't need Notion, Airtable, or a CRM yet. You need a place to write things down and a spreadsheet.</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, Drive).</p>

      <p>A simple Google Sheet can be your CRM, your content calendar, and your financial model. Google Docs is where you write your SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for your future AI agents. It's robust, collaborative, and you already have it.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month (personal account).</p>

      <h2>5. Customer Support: WhatsApp</h2>

      <p>People hate filling out "Contact Us" forms. They want answers now. And you want to be accessible, but on your own terms.</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> WhatsApp Business.</p>

      <p>Create a WhatsApp link for your site. When customers click it, they text you directly. It feels personal and high-touch, which is your competitive advantage as a solopreneur. Later, you can automate this with agents like <a href="future-of-work-ai-agents-openclaw.html">OpenClaw</a>, but starting out, doing it manually teaches you exactly what your customers need.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month.</p>

      <h2>6. Analytics: Google Analytics</h2>

      <p>You need to know where your traffic is coming from. Are your Twitter threads working? Is your SEO kicking in?</p>

      <p><strong>The Tool:</strong> Google Analytics (GA4).</p>

      <p>It's the industry standard for a reason. It tracks everything. It's free. It integrates with everything.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0/month.</p>

      <h2>The "Why" Behind the Stack</h2>

      <p>Notice a theme? None of these tools have a monthly subscription fee to start. This effectively kills your burn rate.</p>

      <p>When your business costs $0 to run, you have infinite runway. You can experiment, fail, pivot, and try again without the stress of a $500/month SaaS bill draining your savings.</p>

      <p>Once you have revenue, you can upgrade. But until then, keep it lean.</p>
