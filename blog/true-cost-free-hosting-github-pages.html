        <article class="blog-content">

            <p>If you've spent any time in web development, you know that "free" usually comes with an asterisk. Free
                tiers have bandwidth limits. Free plugins have premium upsells. Free platforms inject ads or hold your
                data hostage.</p>

            <p>GitHub Pages is one of the very few exceptions to this rule. It is as close to a genuinely free lunch as
                you will find on the modern web.</p>

            <h2>What Exactly is GitHub Pages?</h2>

            <p>At its core, GitHub is a platform where developers store and collaborate on code (using Git). GitHub
                Pages is a feature built on top of that repository system. If you designate a specific branch (usually
                <code>gh-pages</code> or sometimes just <code>main</code>) to be your "Pages" branch, GitHub will take
                the HTML, CSS, and JS files in that branch and serve them over the web.</p>

            <p>That's it. It's a remarkably simple concept.</p>

            <h2>The Benefits of Static Hosting</h2>

            <p>The catch with GitHub pages is that it can only host <em>static</em> sites. You cannot run a WordPress
                database, a PHP backend, or a Node server on it. But for 90% of business websites, landing pages, and
                blogs, you don't need a backend.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unbeatable Speed:</strong> Because there is no database to query, a static site serves
                    pre-built HTML files instantly. GitHub also automatically distributes these files across its global
                    CDN (Content Delivery Network).</li>
                <li><strong>Bulletproof Security:</strong> You cannot hack a server that doesn't exist. There are no SQL
                    injections or WordPress plugin vulnerabilities to worry about. The "attack surface" of a static HTML
                    file is practically zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> If your blog post goes viral and hits the front page of Hacker
                    News or Reddit, a cheap WordPress server will crash under the load. GitHub Pages will just laugh and
                    keep serving files.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The "Cost" of Using It</h2>

            <p>So, where is the asterisk? Why doesn't everyone use this?</p>

            <p>The barrier to entry isn't money; it's <strong>knowledge</strong>. To use GitHub Pages, you need to
                understand Git. You need to know how to write (or generate) HTML. You have to be comfortable in a
                terminal running commit commands.</p>

            <p>For a non-technical small business owner, paying Squarespace $25 a month is a tax they gladly pay to
                avoid learning the command line.</p>

            <h2>Enter the AI Era</h2>

            <p>This is why the paradigm is shifting right now. The knowledge barrier that protected platforms like Wix
                and WordPress is dissolving.</p>

            <p>Tools like Claude Code can write the HTML for you. Automation tools like Google Jule can handle the Git
                commits and push them to your repository autonomously. Suddenly, the technical friction is gone.</p>

            <p>You can now have the un-hackable speed, infinite scalability, and zero-dollar monthly cost of GitHub
                Pages, without needing a computer science degree. You just have to know how to talk to the AI.</p>
