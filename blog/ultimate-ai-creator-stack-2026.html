      <p>People ask me how I run a media company, a software business, and a consulting firm with zero employees. The answer isn't "I work 80 hours a week." The answer is my stack.</p>

      <p>In 2026, the solo creator has the power of a 50-person agency. But only if you use the right tools. Here is the exact list of 17 tools I use every single day.</p>

      <h2>Content Production</h2>

      <p><strong>1. Gemini.</strong> My first draft. I use it for research, outlining scripts, and brainstorming angles. It's the writer's room I don't pay for.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Google Flow.</strong> The video production team. I feed my Gemini scripts into Flow to generate cinematic b-roll and explainer visuals. It's not perfect, but it's 80% cheaper than stock footage.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Suno.</strong> The sound engineer. I need background music? I need a jingle? I need a full song for a TikTok trend? Suno generates it in seconds. No copyright strikes, ever.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Google Pomeli.</strong> The brand manager. With so much AI content, it's easy to lose your voice. Pomeli checks every piece of content against my brand guidelines before it goes out. It's the "quality control" layer.</p>

      <h2>Distribution</h2>

      <p><strong>5. YouTube.</strong> The long-form home. Everything starts here. High-quality, depth-first content.</p>

      <p><strong>6. TikTok.</strong> The discovery engine. I use clips from the main videos, remix them with Suno tracks, and let the algorithm do the work.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Instagram.</strong> The aesthetic layer. Reels for reach, Stories for connection.</p>

      <p><strong>8. Facebook.</strong> Yes, Facebook. Specifically for Groups. It's where the real communities still live.</p>

      <p><strong>9. Reddit.</strong> The pulse. I don't just post; I listen. It's the best place to find out what problems people actually have.</p>

      <h2>Development & Operations</h2>

      <p><strong>10. Claude Code.</strong> The developer. I built this website with it. I build my internal tools with it. It writes the code, I just steer.</p>

      <p><strong>11. GitHub.</strong> The home base. Free hosting for my sites (Pages) and the repository for all my automation scripts.</p>

      <p><strong>12. Claude Cowork.</strong> The project manager. It organizes my files, sorts my downloads, and prepares assets for publishing.</p>

      <p><strong>13. OpenClaw.</strong> The personal assistant. Need to book a flight? Need to find an email from 3 months ago? OpenClaw handles the "life admin" stuff that kills productivity.</p>

      <h2>Business & Analytics</h2>

      <p><strong>14. Stripe.</strong> The bank. If you can't take money, you don't have a business. I use Stripe Payment Links for everything.</p>

      <p><strong>15. Kit.</strong> The relationship. Social media is rented land. My email list (on Kit) is the only thing I own. It connects seamlessly with Stripe.</p>

      <p><strong>16. Google Apps.</strong> The plumbing. Gmail, Sheets, Docs. But I don't use them manually. I use Apps Script to glue them together.</p>

      <p><strong>17. Google Analytics.</strong> The scoreboard. If you don't measure it, you can't improve it.</p>

      <h2> WhatsApp: The Command Center</h2>

      <p>And finally, <strong>WhatsApp</strong>. This is where it all comes together. My OpenClaw agent lives here. I text it tasks, it updates my Notion, it emails my list, it deploys my code. My entire business is run from a chat window.</p>

      <p>This isn't the future. This is now. You can build an empire from your phone, or you can keep making excuses.</p>
