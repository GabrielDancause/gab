      <p>Hey, I'm Gab. I run a 60+ room hotel in Quebec, and I built all my business websites myself — without knowing how to code. No web developer, no agency, no $200/month website builder subscription. Just me, Claude Code, and GitHub Pages.</p>

      <p>By the end of this course, you'll have a professional, live website with a real URL that you can share with anyone. It'll be fast, it'll look great on phones, and it'll cost you exactly zero dollars per month to host. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

      <h2>The End Result</h2>

      <p>What you're building is a real, professional website. Not a "looks like it was made with a template" website. A clean, fast, mobile-responsive site that loads instantly and makes your business look legit.</p>

      <p>This is the kind of site that businesses pay $2,000–$5,000 to have built. You're going to do it yourself in about two hours.</p>

      <h2>Why This Beats Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress</h2>

      <p>Look, I've used them all. Here's my honest take:</p>

      <p><strong>Wix and Squarespace</strong> charge you $15–$45/month. That's $180–$540 per year. For a basic business website. And you're locked into their system — if you stop paying, your site disappears. Your site also loads slower because it's packed with their bloated code and tracking scripts.</p>

      <p><strong>WordPress</strong> is "free" but you still need hosting ($5–$30/month), you need to deal with plugins, updates, security patches, and the occasional hack. I've had WordPress sites get compromised. It's a headache.</p>

      <p><strong>Claude Code + GitHub Pages</strong> gives you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>$0/month hosting.</strong> GitHub Pages is completely free. Forever.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster sites.</strong> Your site is just clean HTML and CSS — no bloated page builder code slowing things down.</li>
        <li><strong>Full control.</strong> You own every line of code. No platform lock-in.</li>
        <li><strong>No maintenance headaches.</strong> No plugins to update, no security vulnerabilities, no databases to manage.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom everything.</strong> Want to change something? Just ask Claude Code. No wrestling with drag-and-drop editors that never put things where you want them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The only cost is Claude Code itself, which requires an Anthropic API subscription. But compared to paying a web developer or a monthly website builder fee, it's nothing.</p>

      <h2>What Is Claude Code?</h2>

      <p>Claude Code is a tool made by Anthropic that lets you talk to an AI directly in your terminal (that black window where you type commands — don't worry, I'll show you). You describe what you want in plain English, and it writes the code for you.</p>

      <p>Think of it like having a web developer sitting next to you who works instantly, never gets annoyed at your requests, and lets you make unlimited revisions. You say "build me a website for my bakery with a warm color scheme," and it just… does it. HTML, CSS, the whole thing. You say "make the heading bigger" and it makes the heading bigger.</p>

      <p>It's not magic — it's just a really good AI that understands code. And the beautiful part is: you don't need to understand the code yourself. You just need to describe what you want.</p>

      <h2>What Is GitHub Pages?</h2>

      <p>GitHub is where developers store their code. Think of it like Google Drive, but for code. GitHub Pages is a free feature that takes your code and turns it into a live website.</p>

      <p>You push your website files to GitHub, flip a switch, and boom — your site is live at <code>yourusername.github.io/your-site-name</code>. Free. Reliable. Used by millions of websites. GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so it's not going anywhere.</p>

      <p>Later, if you want, you can connect your own domain name (like <code>yourbusiness.com</code>) to it. But the free URL works perfectly fine to start.</p>

      <h2>What You'll Need</h2>

      <p>Here's your shopping list:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>A computer.</strong> Mac or Windows, doesn't matter. Even a basic laptop is fine.</li>
        <li><strong>An internet connection.</strong> For the setup and deploying your site. You can actually edit offline once everything's installed.</li>
        <li><strong>About 2 hours.</strong> Maybe less if you're quick. The first 30 minutes is setup, the rest is building.</li>
        <li><strong>An Anthropic account.</strong> For Claude Code. You'll set this up in the next module.</li>
        <li><strong>A GitHub account.</strong> Free. You'll set this up too.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>That's it. No design skills needed. No coding knowledge needed. If you can type a sentence describing what you want, you can build a website.</p>

      <h2>What You'll Have by the End</h2>

      <p>By the time you finish this course, you will have:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A multi-page website (Home, About, Contact — or whatever pages you need)</li>
        <li>A professional design with proper fonts, colors, and spacing</li>
        <li>A site that looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops</li>
        <li>A live URL you can share with anyone</li>
        <li>The knowledge to update your site anytime you want, just by talking to Claude Code</li>
      </ul>

      <p>No ongoing costs. No dependencies on anyone else. Full ownership of everything.</p>

      <p>Let's get your tools set up.</p>
