      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>I spent months in Bangkok figuring this out through trial, error, and way too many awkward moments. This guide is everything I wish someone had told me before I walked into my first bar completely clueless.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The specific streets and sois where BJ bars are concentrated (not just "Sukhumvit" — actual locations)</li>
        <li>Realistic pricing breakdowns — what you should pay vs. what they'll try to charge a tourist</li>
        <li>The exact process from walking in to walking out, step by step</li>
        <li>Safety tips that actually matter — what to watch for and what's not worth worrying about</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Expect Inside</h2>
      <p>If you've never been, the setup is nothing like what you're imagining. It's not shady or sketchy — most of these places are surprisingly chill. But there's an etiquette to it that nobody posts about online.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How the seating, ordering, and selection process actually works</li>
        <li>What the girls expect from you (and what they don't)</li>
        <li>Tipping norms — when to tip, how much, and what happens if you don't</li>
        <li>The stuff you should NOT do — things that will get you overcharged or kicked out</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>This isn't a morality debate. If you're going to go, you might as well go informed. This guide is for guys who want the real info without the judgment or the Reddit horror stories.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First-timers in Bangkok who've heard about this and want to know what's real vs. exaggerated</li>
        <li>Guys who've already been but felt like they overpaid or didn't know the protocol</li>
        <li>Anyone who wants a straightforward, honest breakdown without the creepy forum energy</li>
      </ul>
