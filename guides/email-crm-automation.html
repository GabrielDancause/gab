      <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
      <p>Every lead you don't follow up with is money you're leaving on the table. I learned this the hard way &mdash; for years I was manually emailing hotel guests, following up with business leads in my head, and losing track of who needed what. This tutorial is the system I built to fix all of that, and it runs on autopilot.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to choose the right CRM for your business size and budget (I'll share what I actually use and why)</li>
        <li>Building email sequences that nurture leads without sounding like spam</li>
        <li>Lead scoring basics &mdash; how to know which leads deserve your time and which ones aren't ready</li>
        <li>Setting up automated follow-ups that feel personal, not robotic</li>
        <li>Segmentation strategies and the exact email templates I send to hotel guests and business leads</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>You'll walk away with a fully mapped CRM pipeline and at least one automated email sequence ready to deploy. No more leads slipping through the cracks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to set up a CRM from scratch and organize your contacts in a way that actually makes sense</li>
        <li>The anatomy of a high-performing email sequence &mdash; timing, subject lines, and content that gets replies</li>
        <li>How to build automated follow-up workflows that trigger based on customer behavior</li>
        <li>My segmentation framework for sending the right message to the right person at the right time</li>
        <li>How to track open rates, click rates, and conversions so you can improve over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>If you have customers or leads and no system for staying in touch with them, this is the tutorial that will change how your business operates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Business owners with no email system in place who know they should have one</li>
        <li>Anyone manually following up with leads via sticky notes, memory, or scattered spreadsheets</li>
        <li>Operators who want to nurture customers on autopilot while they focus on higher-value work</li>
        <li>Hospitality and service businesses that want to turn one-time customers into repeat guests</li>
      </ul>
