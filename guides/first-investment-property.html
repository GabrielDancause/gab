      <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
      <p>This is the tutorial I needed when I was staring at MLS listings at midnight, second-guessing every number on my spreadsheet. I walk you through the entire process of buying your first rental property, from the moment you decide you want in to the day you collect your first rent check. No theory from someone who read a book about it. This is what I actually did, what worked, and what I would do differently.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to research markets and pick a location that makes financial sense, not just one that feels good</li>
        <li>Financing options broken down plainly: conventional, DSCR, private lending, and what banks actually look at</li>
        <li>How to calculate ROI, cash-on-cash return, and monthly cash flow without overcomplicating it</li>
        <li>Walking through the offer process: what to include, how to negotiate, and when to walk away</li>
        <li>Property inspections: what to look for yourself and what to let the inspector handle</li>
        <li>Property management basics so you don't become a 24/7 landlord on day one</li>
        <li>My actual first deal breakdown: the numbers, the timeline, the surprises, and the lessons</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear framework for evaluating deals, structuring financing, and making offers with confidence. You will stop guessing and start running real numbers on real properties.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to build a simple deal analysis spreadsheet that tells you within minutes if a property is worth pursuing</li>
        <li>The financing strategy that let me get started without draining my savings account</li>
        <li>What a good cap rate and cash-on-cash return actually look like in practice</li>
        <li>How to spot red flags during property tours that most first-time buyers miss</li>
        <li>The exact process for making an offer that protects you while staying competitive</li>
        <li>How to set up basic property management systems from day one so nothing slips through the cracks</li>
        <li>A realistic timeline of what the first 90 days of owning a rental property actually looks like</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>You do not need experience or a real estate license. You need the willingness to learn and enough honesty with yourself to run the numbers instead of relying on gut feelings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First-time real estate investors who want a clear, start-to-finish roadmap without the fluff</li>
        <li>People sitting on savings who want to start building wealth but feel paralyzed by all the conflicting advice out there</li>
        <li>Anyone intimidated by real estate who wants a no-BS walkthrough from someone who has actually been through it</li>
      </ul>
