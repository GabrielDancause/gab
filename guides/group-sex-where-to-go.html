This guide is my honest, city-by-city breakdown of where to actually go — and what to skip — if you're looking for group experiences that are safe, fun, and worth your time.</p>

      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>This isn't a directory you can Google. It's my personal, tested recommendations — the places I'd send a friend to if they asked me where to go. I cover the full spectrum: from high-end clubs to underground events to apps that actually work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My ranked list of cities worldwide — which ones deliver and which ones are overhyped</li>
        <li>The different types of venues: lifestyle clubs, sex-positive parties, app-organized meetups, resort events</li>
        <li>What each city's scene is actually like — vibe, crowd, pricing, dress code</li>
        <li>The apps and platforms that work for finding group experiences (and the ones full of fakes)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Cities &amp; Venues</h2>
      <p>I go deep on specific cities — not just "Berlin is great." I tell you which neighborhood, which night to go, how to get on the guest list, and what the crowd is like on a given evening. Some cities have world-class venues hiding in plain sight. Others have a big reputation but zero delivery.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>European cities that live up to the hype — and the one everyone recommends that I think is mediocre</li>
        <li>The Latin American cities with a growing scene most travelers don't know about</li>
        <li>Southeast Asian options — what exists, what's legit, and what to avoid</li>
        <li>Solo entry vs. couple entry — where singles are welcome and where you need a partner to get in</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>Beyond the "where," I cover the "how." Walking into a sex club or group event for the first time can be intimidating. I break down the unwritten rules so you don't embarrass yourself — or worse, make someone else uncomfortable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Etiquette and consent rules that apply everywhere — the stuff nobody tells you before your first time</li>
        <li>How to prepare: what to wear, what to bring, how to handle nerves</li>
        <li>The difference between watching, participating, and initiating — and how to read the room</li>
        <li>What I personally recommend for first-timers vs. people who've done this before</li>
      </ul>
