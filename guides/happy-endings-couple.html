      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>Most guides on this topic are written for solo guys. This one is different. I've been through this with a partner and I've heard from dozens of couples who've done the same. This is the playbook for doing it together — the right way.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to gauge whether your partner might be open to it (before you even bring it up)</li>
        <li>The specific places around the world that are genuinely welcoming to couples</li>
        <li>What a couple's experience actually looks like — from booking to what happens inside</li>
        <li>How to handle the emotional side — before, during, and especially after</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Having the Conversation</h2>
      <p>This is where most guys mess it up. They either blurt it out at the worst possible time or they hint around it so vaguely that it comes across as sketchy. There's a better way to have this conversation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When and where to bring it up — timing and context matter more than you think</li>
        <li>How to frame it as a shared adventure, not a "thing you want to do to someone else"</li>
        <li>What to do if they say no — and why pushing it is the worst possible move</li>
        <li>Signs that your partner is genuinely interested vs. just going along with it to please you</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Expect Together</h2>
      <p>Going as a couple changes the entire dynamic. Some things are better, some things are more complicated. I walk you through all of it so there are zero surprises.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How couple-friendly parlors handle two people — same room, separate rooms, and what I recommend</li>
        <li>Navigating jealousy in real time — practical strategies that actually work</li>
        <li>The debrief after — why this conversation is just as important as the experience itself</li>
        <li>Couples who loved it vs. couples who regretted it — what made the difference</li>
      </ul>
