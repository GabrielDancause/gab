      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>I lived in Montreal and spent a lot of time figuring out how this scene actually works here. It's nothing like Thailand — the pricing, the way you find places, the vibe inside, it's all different. This guide saves you from the guesswork.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How Montreal's massage parlor scene is structured — the types of places that exist and how to tell them apart</li>
        <li>The legal landscape in Canada — what's technically legal, what's gray area, and what you should know</li>
        <li>Realistic pricing in Canadian dollars — base massage cost, extras, and what tipping looks like here</li>
        <li>How to find places — the websites, directories, and signals that locals actually use</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Montreal Scene</h2>
      <p>Montreal is liberal, bilingual, and has its own way of doing things. The scene here is more discreet than Southeast Asia but more accessible than most other North American cities. You just need to know where to look.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neighborhoods where parlors are concentrated and which areas to avoid</li>
        <li>The difference between licensed massage therapy clinics and the places that offer extras</li>
        <li>Why the bilingual factor matters — what to say and how language affects the experience</li>
        <li>Quality differences — what separates a great experience from a forgettable one</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>After this guide, you'll understand how Montreal's scene works from the inside. No more guessing based on sketchy forum posts from 2014.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step-by-step: what happens from the moment you call or walk in to the moment you leave</li>
        <li>How to read online listings and reviews to figure out what a place actually offers</li>
        <li>Red flags that a place is low quality, overpriced, or not worth your time</li>
        <li>Canada vs. Asia — a direct comparison of experience, pricing, and what to expect</li>
      </ul>
