      <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
      <p>I used to do everything myself. Every email, every decision, every tiny operational task. It nearly burned me out, and it definitely slowed my businesses down. Learning to hire well and delegate effectively was the single biggest unlock in my career. This tutorial covers the entire process &mdash; from knowing when it's time to hire, to actually letting go of control.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When to hire &mdash; the signals that tell you it's time to bring someone on (and when it's too early)</li>
        <li>Where to find the right people &mdash; the platforms, networks, and strategies that actually produce quality candidates</li>
        <li>My interview process &mdash; the questions I ask, the red flags I watch for, and how I evaluate fit</li>
        <li>Building an onboarding system that gets new hires productive fast without hand-holding</li>
        <li>The delegation framework I use to hand off work and trust that it gets done right</li>
        <li>How to create SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) that make delegation repeatable</li>
        <li>Common hiring and delegation mistakes that cost me real money &mdash; so you can avoid them</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a hiring process, an onboarding system, and a delegation framework ready to use. The goal is simple: stop being the bottleneck.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to write job descriptions that attract the right people instead of flooding your inbox with bad fits</li>
        <li>A structured interview process you can run in 30 minutes that tells you more than a two-hour conversation</li>
        <li>My onboarding checklist &mdash; the exact steps I take during someone's first two weeks</li>
        <li>The delegation ladder: how to go from "I do everything" to "I review results" without losing quality</li>
        <li>How to build SOPs using Loom and Notion so any task can be handed off cleanly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>If you know you need help but you keep telling yourself "it's faster if I just do it" &mdash; this tutorial is the wake-up call and the playbook in one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solo operators who are ready to hire their first person but don't know where to start</li>
        <li>Founders who can't stop micromanaging and know it's holding their business back</li>
        <li>Anyone stuck as the bottleneck in their business &mdash; where nothing moves without their input</li>
        <li>Growing teams that need better systems for onboarding and handing off responsibilities</li>
      </ul>
