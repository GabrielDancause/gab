      <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
      <p>Most hotel operators set their rates once and hope for the best. I did the same thing for longer than I would like to admit. This tutorial is everything I have learned about pricing since then: the strategy behind dynamic rates, how to manage OTAs without letting them eat all your margin, and how to build a direct booking channel that actually competes. These are the systems running in my property right now.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic pricing fundamentals: what it is, why it works, and how to implement it without expensive consultants</li>
        <li>Setting rate tiers: how to structure your room types and rate plans so pricing makes sense to guests and to your bottom line</li>
        <li>OTA channel management: keeping Booking.com, Expedia, and other platforms in sync without overbooking or losing control</li>
        <li>Commission optimization: understanding what you are actually paying OTAs and where you can negotiate or reduce fees</li>
        <li>Direct booking strategy: how to get guests to book through your own site instead of through an OTA</li>
        <li>Revenue metrics that matter: RevPAR, ADR, occupancy rate, and how to read them together to make smart decisions</li>
        <li>Seasonal adjustments: how to plan your pricing calendar around demand patterns instead of reacting to them</li>
        <li>The exact tools I use: the software, dashboards, and workflows behind my pricing decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>You will leave this tutorial with a pricing system you can implement immediately. Not a vague concept of revenue management, but a practical approach you can apply to your property this week.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to set up dynamic pricing that adjusts automatically based on demand, lead time, and competitor rates</li>
        <li>A rate tier structure that maximizes revenue across different room categories and booking windows</li>
        <li>How to manage multiple OTA channels efficiently without spending hours on manual updates</li>
        <li>The direct booking tactics that have consistently shifted revenue away from high-commission OTAs toward my own channels</li>
        <li>How to read RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy together to understand whether your pricing strategy is actually working</li>
        <li>A seasonal pricing calendar template you can customize for your market and demand patterns</li>
        <li>The specific tools and integrations I rely on to make pricing decisions without guesswork</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>If you have ever looked at a competitor's rate and just matched it, or if you set your prices in January and did not touch them again, this tutorial is going to change how you think about revenue.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hotel operators who know they are leaving money on the table but are not sure where to start with pricing strategy</li>
        <li>Anyone managing OTA listings who wants to reduce commission costs and take back control of their distribution</li>
        <li>Operators who set prices by gut feeling and want a repeatable system that is based on actual data and demand signals</li>
      </ul>
