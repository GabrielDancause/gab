      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>This is the most personal guide I've made. I walk you through my actual experiences — the context, the buildup, the moment, and the aftermath. Not to brag. To teach. Because nobody learns from a Wikipedia article about threesomes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The full story of my first threesome — how it happened, where I found the third, and what I didn't see coming</li>
        <li>The time it went completely sideways and what I learned from it</li>
        <li>How I found willing partners — the apps, the conversations, the signals to look for</li>
        <li>The emotional side: jealousy, excitement, vulnerability, and how it affected my relationships</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real Stories, Real Lessons</h2>
      <p>Each story in this guide comes with a breakdown of what worked and what didn't. I'm not just telling you what happened — I'm showing you what I'd change if I could do it again. These aren't sanitized or exaggerated. They're just honest.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The communication that happened before, during, and after — exact conversations I had</li>
        <li>How alcohol and nerves played a role (and why I stopped relying on liquid courage)</li>
        <li>The difference between a threesome that brings people closer and one that creates distance</li>
        <li>Specific mistakes I made with timing, boundaries, and assumptions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Take Away</h2>
      <p>By the end of this guide, you'll have a realistic picture of what threesomes are actually like — not the fantasy version, the real version. I give you a practical framework you can use whether you're single, dating, or in a long-term relationship.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A step-by-step approach to bringing up the idea with a partner without making it weird</li>
        <li>Where and how to find a third person who's genuinely interested (not just performing)</li>
        <li>The conversation checklist I use now before every group experience</li>
        <li>How to handle the morning after — because that's where most people fall apart</li>
      </ul>
