      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>I lived in the Netherlands and went to more saunas than I can count. The first time was nerve-wracking. By the third time, I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. This guide is everything I learned so your first time isn't a mess.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why Dutch saunas are naked-only and why wearing a swimsuit actually makes you the weird one</li>
        <li>The unwritten rules — where to sit, where to look, how to use your towel, and the stuff nobody explains</li>
        <li>My top sauna recommendations across the Netherlands — from Amsterdam to smaller towns</li>
        <li>What to bring, what to leave at home, and what they provide on-site</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dutch Sauna Culture</h2>
      <p>The Dutch see nudity in saunas the same way North Americans see shoes in a house — it's just normal. Understanding that mindset makes the whole experience click. I break down the cultural side so you're not just going through the motions, you're actually getting it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mixed-gender vs. single-gender sessions — when they happen and what the vibe is like for each</li>
        <li>The "aufguss" ritual — what it is, why it's amazing, and the etiquette around it</li>
        <li>How regulars behave vs. how tourists behave — and why you want to be in the first group</li>
        <li>Going as a couple vs. solo — what changes and what stays the same</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>By the end of this guide, you'll walk into a Dutch sauna looking like you've been going for years. No awkward towel clutching, no wrong moves, just a genuinely great experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A full walkthrough of a typical visit — from arrival and changing to the sauna circuits and cool-down pools</li>
        <li>How to handle the body confidence thing — real talk on getting comfortable being naked around strangers</li>
        <li>Food, drinks, and relaxation areas — how to make a full day of it</li>
        <li>Pricing and booking — what a day costs and whether memberships are worth it</li>
      </ul>
