      <p class="guide-desc">Nobody talks about this honestly. When you travel, you'll encounter situations where the line between dating and transaction gets blurry. I've been in those moments — confused, uncomfortable, unsure what was expected. This guide is about learning to read those situations, communicate clearly, and handle money conversations without being disrespectful or getting taken advantage of.</p>

      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>I tackle the topic most travel content avoids completely. This guide is about the grey area — when you're not sure if someone expects money, when cultural norms make things confusing, and how to speak up for yourself without being a jerk about it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to recognize when a situation is transactional vs. genuine — the signals most people miss</li>
        <li>Country-by-country cultural context: what's normal in one place is offensive in another</li>
        <li>The exact phrases and conversations I use to clarify expectations early</li>
        <li>Common scams targeting travelers and how to spot them before you're in too deep</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Grey Area Nobody Talks About</h2>
      <p>Here's the truth: in many parts of the world, the line between dating and transactional relationships isn't as clear as it is back home. Someone might genuinely like you and also expect financial support. Someone might be a professional and you had no idea. I don't judge any of it — I just help you understand what you're walking into.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "girlfriend experience" dynamic — what it is and how it works in different countries</li>
        <li>When buying someone dinner or drinks carries different expectations than you think</li>
        <li>How economic disparity changes the dynamic and what that means for consent and respect</li>
        <li>My personal experiences navigating these situations — the times I got it right and the times I didn't</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>This guide isn't pro or anti paying for sex. It's about being honest with yourself and respectful to everyone involved. I give you the tools to have uncomfortable conversations so you can make decisions you're actually comfortable with.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to set boundaries before things escalate — specific language that works across cultures</li>
        <li>The safety essentials: meeting in public first, not carrying too much cash, trusting your gut</li>
        <li>How to be respectful to sex workers if that's the route you choose — basic decency most people lack</li>
        <li>Why learning to speak up about money early saves you from bad situations later</li>
      </ul>
