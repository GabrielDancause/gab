      <h2>What This Tutorial Covers</h2>
      <p>Running a hotel looks exciting from the outside. On the inside, it is an endless stream of operational decisions, staffing puzzles, and small fires that need putting out before guests ever notice. I run a 60+ room property in Charlevoix, and this tutorial is the unfiltered reality of what that looks like day to day. No Instagram highlights, no motivational quotes. Just the systems, the problems, and the solutions I have built over time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The daily operations rhythm: what a typical day looks like from open to close, and how to structure yours</li>
        <li>Staffing and scheduling: how to build a team, manage shifts, and handle the constant turnover that comes with hospitality</li>
        <li>Property management systems (PMS): which ones I have used, what matters, and what is just marketing fluff</li>
        <li>Housekeeping management: quality standards, turnaround times, and the communication systems that keep rooms ready on time</li>
        <li>Maintenance: preventive schedules, emergency response, and how to keep a property in shape without blowing your budget</li>
        <li>Financial tracking: the numbers you need to watch weekly and monthly to know if your property is actually healthy</li>
        <li>Seasonal planning: how to prepare for high season, survive low season, and budget for both</li>
        <li>The stuff that goes wrong: real stories of problems I have dealt with and how I handled them</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>You will get a complete operational playbook for running a hotel, built from actual experience. The kind of knowledge that normally takes years of mistakes to acquire.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to structure your daily operations so the property runs smoothly even when you are not physically there</li>
        <li>A staffing framework that reduces turnover and keeps your team accountable without micromanaging</li>
        <li>What to look for in a PMS and how to get the most out of whatever system you choose</li>
        <li>Housekeeping standards and checklists that keep quality consistent across every room, every day</li>
        <li>A preventive maintenance schedule that catches problems before they become expensive emergencies</li>
        <li>The financial dashboard I check every week and the metrics that actually tell me how the business is doing</li>
        <li>How to plan your year around seasonal demand so you are never caught off guard by slow months</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>This is not a theoretical hospitality course. It is a practical guide for people who are in the business or about to be, and want to know what the job actually demands.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aspiring hotel owners who want the real picture before they sign on the dotted line</li>
        <li>People who inherited or bought a property and are figuring out how to run it without burning out</li>
        <li>Hospitality students who want to understand what daily operations actually look like, not what the textbook says</li>
        <li>Small inn and B&amp;B operators who are ready to scale up and need the systems to support that growth</li>
      </ul>
