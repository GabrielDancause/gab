      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>Think of this as the guide you read before the other guides. I cover all the fundamentals — the practical stuff you need sorted before you even think about specific experiences. This is the guide I wish existed when I started traveling.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safety fundamentals: protecting your health, your belongings, and your identity abroad</li>
        <li>What to pack specifically for sexual experiences while traveling (things you won't find in most countries)</li>
        <li>Cultural awareness 101 — understanding local attitudes toward sex so you don't accidentally offend or endanger yourself</li>
        <li>The common mistakes I see first-timers make again and again — and how to avoid all of them</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Before You Do Anything</h2>
      <p>Most people jump straight into the exciting stuff and skip the boring prep. Don't. I've seen people get into real trouble because they didn't handle the basics. This section is about getting your foundation right so everything else can actually be enjoyable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health and hygiene essentials — STI testing before you leave, what protection to bring, where to get tested abroad</li>
        <li>How to share your location and plans with someone you trust without killing the vibe</li>
        <li>The apps and tools I use to stay safe — from encrypted messaging to location sharing to emergency contacts</li>
        <li>Legal realities: what's legal where, how to check before you arrive, and what happens if things go wrong</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Mindset</h2>
      <p>Here's what separates someone who has great experiences abroad from someone who has awkward or harmful ones: mindset. I'm not talking about "manifesting good vibes." I mean a practical, grounded way of approaching sexual experiences that respects everyone involved — including yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why the "I'm on vacation" mentality gets people into trouble — and what to replace it with</li>
        <li>How to approach new experiences with curiosity instead of entitlement</li>
        <li>Setting your own boundaries before you leave — because you won't think clearly in the moment</li>
        <li>The difference between being adventurous and being reckless — and how to stay on the right side</li>
      </ul>
