      <p class="guide-desc">Most people have no idea what yoni massage actually is — and the internet is full of garbage information about it. I went to Thailand, did the research, talked to practitioners, and put together everything a woman (or her partner) needs to know before booking a session. This guide covers where to go, what it costs, and what really happens in the room.</p>

      <h2>What This Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>I break down yoni massage from start to finish — no mystical fluff, no awkward guessing. Just a clear, honest walkthrough of what to expect if you're considering this in Thailand.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What yoni massage actually involves, step by step — from intake to aftercare</li>
        <li>The specific cities and neighborhoods in Thailand where reputable practitioners work</li>
        <li>Realistic pricing — what you should pay and what's a red flag</li>
        <li>How to vet a practitioner before you book (the exact questions to ask)</li>
        <li>What the session room looks like, how long it takes, and what boundaries are standard</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Yoni Massage Is (And What It Isn't)</h2>
      <p>There's a huge gap between what you'll read online and what actually happens with a skilled practitioner. Yoni massage is a therapeutic practice rooted in Tantric tradition — it's not a happy ending massage with a different name. I explain the difference clearly so you know exactly what you're walking into.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How yoni massage differs from regular Thai massage or spa treatments</li>
        <li>The emotional and therapeutic side — why some women describe it as a release they didn't know they needed</li>
        <li>What clothing stays on, what comes off, and how consent works throughout</li>
        <li>Why Thailand specifically has become a destination for this — the practitioner culture there</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>This guide is for women who are curious but cautious — and for partners who want to understand what their partner might experience. I wrote it because I kept getting the same questions from women who wanted to try this but had no idea where to start without feeling unsafe.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women traveling solo who want a safe, vetted recommendation</li>
        <li>Couples where one or both partners are curious about Tantric bodywork</li>
        <li>Anyone who's been burned by bad information online and wants a real person's honest take</li>
        <li>People already planning a Thailand trip who want to add this to their itinerary</li>
      </ul>
