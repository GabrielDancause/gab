  <div class="doc-abstract">
    Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market (typically the S&P 500). It helps investors understand the systematic risk profile of a security; a beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 implies lower volatility.

      <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

      <h3>Basic Form</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>β = Covariance(Rs, Rm) / Variance(Rm)

Where:
Rs = Return of the individual stock
Rm = Return of the market index</code></pre>

      <p>The formula compares how a stock's returns move relative to the market's returns. <strong>Covariance</strong> measures how the two variables (stock price and market index) move together, while <strong>Variance</strong> measures how far the market's data points are spread out from their average. These figures are calculated using historical price data, not from the Balance Sheet or Income Statement.</p>

      <h3>Worked Example</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Company</th><th>Volatility Profile</th><th>Correlation to Market</th><th>Beta</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Company A (Utility)</td><td>Low Price Swings</td><td>High (0.8)</td><td><strong>0.5</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Company B (Tech)</td><td>High Price Swings</td><td>High (0.8)</td><td><strong>1.5</strong></td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Company A has a Beta of 0.5, meaning it theoretically moves only 50% as much as the market (a defensive stock). Company B has a Beta of 1.5, suggesting it is 50% more volatile than the market. Aggressive investors might prefer B during bull markets to amplify gains, while conservative investors would choose A to preserve capital.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        High beta doesn't always mean "better returns". It means "more movement". In a market crash, high beta stocks typically fall much harder than low beta stocks.

      <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

      <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>
        • <strong>β = 1:</strong> The stock moves in lockstep with the market.<br>
        • <strong>β > 1:</strong> The stock is more volatile (riskier) than the market. Examples include tech startups and cyclicals.<br>
        • <strong>β < 1:</strong> The stock is less volatile (safer) than the market. Examples include utilities and consumer staples.<br>
        • <strong>β < 0:</strong> The stock moves inversely to the market (rare, e.g., gold or inverse ETFs).
      </p>

      <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
      <p>Beta is strictly backward-looking based on historical data. Past volatility does not guarantee future risk. A company can have a low historical beta but face a new, catastrophic risk (e.g., bankruptcy) that the historical data hasn't captured yet. It also assumes market efficiency, which is not always the case.</p>
      
      <div class="callout callout-warn">
        Do not use Beta in isolation for valuation. It is a risk metric, not a quality metric. A terrible company can have a low beta simply because it doesn't trade often (liquidity risk) or has uncorrelated movements.
