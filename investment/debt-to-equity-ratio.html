    <div class="doc-abstract">
      The Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio is a solvency metric that compares a company's total debt to its total shareholder
      equity. It illustrates how aggressively a company is financing its growth with borrowed money (leverage) versus
      its own cash (equity). A high ratio indicates a risky, highly-leveraged capital structure.

        <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

        <h3>Basic Form</h3>
        <pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>D/E Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity</code></pre>

        <p>Both figures are found on the company's Balance Sheet. "Total Liabilities" encompasses all short-term and
          long-term debt, while "Total Shareholders' Equity" represents the net asset value of the company's stock.</p>

        <h3>Worked Example</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Company</th>
              <th>Total Liabilities</th>
              <th>Total Equity</th>
              <th>D/E Ratio</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Company X</td>
              <td>$500M</td>
              <td>$1,000M</td>
              <td><strong>0.50</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company Y</td>
              <td>$1,500M</td>
              <td>$500M</td>
              <td><strong>3.00</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company Z</td>
              <td>$0M</td>
              <td>$800M</td>
              <td><strong>0.00</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Company X has half as much debt as it does equity, demonstrating a strong, conservative balance sheet.
          Company Y has three times more debt than equity; while they may be generating higher ROE by borrowing money,
          their insolvency risk during a downturn is massive. Company Z is completely debt-free.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          Because debt turbo-charges the balance sheet, a highly leveraged company (high D/E) will typically show an
          artificially high Return on Equity (ROE) via the DuPont equation.

        <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>Like all ratios, D/E must be compared inside its specific industry sector:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0.0 - 0.5:</strong> Exceptional financial strength. The company runs entirely off its own cash.
            Common in dominant tech monopolies.</li>
          <li><strong>1.0 - 2.0:</strong> Normal range for capital-intensive companies (e.g., manufacturing, automakers,
            airlines). They must borrow to buy expensive machinery.</li>
          <li><strong>> 2.5:</strong> Typical of financial institutions, banks, or highly leveraged buyout targets.
            Banks inherently operate with D/E ratios of 10.0 or more because deposits count as liabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
        <p>A D/E ratio of 5.0 sounds terrifying—but what if that debt is locked in for 30 years at 1% interest? The D/E
          ratio fails to account for the *cost of servicing the debt*.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          Never use Debt-to-Equity alone. You must pair it with the <strong>Interest Coverage Ratio</strong>. If a
          company owes a billion dollars but generates ten billion dollars in free cash flow every year, the debt load
          is completely trivial, even if the D/E ratio looks high.
