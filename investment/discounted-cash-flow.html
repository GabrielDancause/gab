  <div class="doc-abstract">
    Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It works on the principle that the value of a company today is the sum of all money it will generate in the future, discounted back to the present.

        <tr><td>Type</td><td>Valuation Model</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Formula</td><td>DCF = Sum of (CF / (1+r)^n)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Good Target</td><td>Intrinsic Value > Share Price (Margin of Safety)</td></tr>

      <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

      <h3>Basic Form</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>DCF = [CF1 / (1+r)^1] + [CF2 / (1+r)^2] + ... + [CFn / (1+r)^n]

Where:
CF = Free Cash Flow for a given year
r = Discount Rate (usually WACC)
n = Time period (years)</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</strong> is found by taking Operating Cash Flow and subtracting Capital Expenditures (from the Cash Flow Statement). The <strong>Discount Rate (r)</strong> represents the risk or opportunity cost of the investment, often calculated using WACC or CAPM.</p>

      <h3>Worked Example</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Company</th><th>Total Present Value of CFs</th><th>Current Share Price</th><th>Valuation Status</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Company A</td><td>$150.00</td><td>$100.00</td><td><strong>Undervalued</strong></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Company B</td><td>$80.00</td><td>$100.00</td><td><strong>Overvalued</strong></td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>After projecting future cash flows and discounting them back to today, Company A has an Intrinsic Value of $150 per share, but trades at $100, offering a 50% margin of safety. Company B trades at $100 but is only worth $80 based on its future cash generation, making it a poor investment.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        Money today is worth more than money tomorrow due to inflation and opportunity cost. That is why we "discount" future cash flows—to see what that future money is actually worth in today's dollars.

      <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

      <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>
        • <strong>Value > Price:</strong> The stock is trading at a discount (Buy signal).<br>
        • <strong>Value < Price:</strong> The stock is trading at a premium (Sell/Hold signal).<br>
        • <strong>Margin of Safety:</strong> Value investors typically look for a 20-30% gap between Intrinsic Value and Price to account for errors.
      </p>

      <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
      <p>DCF is extremely sensitive to assumptions. A small change in the Growth Rate or Discount Rate can double or halve the valuation. This is known as "Garbage In, Garbage Out". It is also unreliable for high-growth tech startups with negative cash flows.</p>
      
      <div class="callout callout-warn">
        The "Terminal Value" (value of the company after the projection period) often accounts for 60-70% of the total DCF value. Be very careful not to overestimate the perpetual growth rate used here.
