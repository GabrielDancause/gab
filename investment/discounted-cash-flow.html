    <div class="doc-abstract">
      Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is an absolute valuation method used to estimate the intrinsic value of an
      investment based on its expected future cash flows. It rests on the foundational financial principle that the
      value of any asset is the present value of all the cash it will ever generate, discounted back to today at an
      appropriate rate of return to account for time value and risk.

        <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

        <h3>Basic Form</h3>
        <pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>DCF = (CF1 / (1+r)^1) + (CF2 / (1+r)^2) + ... + (CFn / (1+r)^n) + TV

Where:
CF = Expected Free Cash Flow for a given year
r = Discount rate (usually WACC)
n = Time period in years
TV = Terminal Value (the value of the business beyond the forecast period)</code></pre>

        <p>The DCF model projects free cash flows (FCF) for a specific horizon (usually 5 to 10 years). Because cash
          generated 10 years from now is worth less than cash today, each year's cash flow is divided by a discount
          factor <code>(1 + r)^t</code>. Finally, a Terminal Value is calculated to estimate the perpetual value of the
          business past the explicit forecast period.</p>

        <h3>Worked Example</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Year</th>
              <th>Projected FCF</th>
              <th>Discount Factor (10%)</th>
              <th>Present Value (PV)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Year 1</td>
              <td>$100M</td>
              <td>1.10</td>
              <td><strong>$90.9M</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Year 2</td>
              <td>$110M</td>
              <td>1.21</td>
              <td><strong>$90.9M</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Year 3</td>
              <td>$121M</td>
              <td>1.33</td>
              <td><strong>$90.9M</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Terminal Value</td>
              <td>$1,500M</td>
              <td>1.33</td>
              <td><strong>$1,126.9M</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="border-top: 2px solid #ddd;">
              <td><strong>Total Enterprise Value</strong></td>
              <td></td>
              <td></td>
              <td><strong>$1,399.6M</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>In this simple 3-year model with a 10% discount rate, the total present value of the cash flows plus the
          terminal value is approximately $1.4 Billion. If the company has NO debt and 100 million shares outstanding,
          the intrinsic value per share is $14.00. If the stock trades at $10.00, it is theoretically undervalued by
          40%.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          The Terminal Value usually accounts for 60% to 80% of a DCF's total valuation. Because it relies heavily on
          assumption (the perpetual growth rate), the terminal value is the most sensitive and heavily scrutinized part
          of a DCF.

        <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

        <h3>Interpreting the Output</h3>
        <p>A DCF yields an "Intrinsic Price Target." Investors compare this target to the current market price:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intrinsic Value > Current Price (e.g., $50 vs $30):</strong> The stock is undervalued. Investors
            typically look for a "margin of safety" of 20-30% below intrinsic value before buying.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrinsic Value = Current Price:</strong> The stock is fairly valued. You will exactly earn the
            discount rate if holding the stock.</li>
          <li><strong>Intrinsic Value < Current Price:</strong> The stock is overvalued.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
        <p>A DCF is only as good as its inputs ("Garbage in, garbage out"). Minor changes to the discount rate or
          terminal growth rate can wildly alter the output.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          DCF analysis is terrible for early-stage startups, highly cyclical companies (like commodity miners), or
          distressed companies, because projecting precise cash flows 5 years out for these businesses is practically
          impossible. Use DCF for mature, cash-generating businesses.
