    <div class="doc-abstract">
      Dividend Yield is a simple financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative
      to its stock price. It allows income investors to quickly assess the cash return on investment they would receive
      by holding the stock, making it easy to compare dividend-paying equities with fixed-income assets like bonds.

        <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

        <h3>Basic Form</h3>
        <pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Share Price) × 100</code></pre>

        <p>The <strong>Annual Dividend per Share</strong> is the sum of the dividends paid over the past 12 months
          (trailing yield) or the most recent quarter's dividend multiplied by four (forward yield). The <strong>Current
            Share Price</strong> is simply the market price of the stock. Because the stock price fluctuates daily, the
          dividend yield changes daily as well.</p>

        <h3>Worked Example</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Company</th>
              <th>Annual Dividend</th>
              <th>Share Price</th>
              <th>Dividend Yield</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Company A</td>
              <td>$4.00</td>
              <td>$100.00</td>
              <td><strong>4.0%</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company B</td>
              <td>$4.00</td>
              <td>$200.00</td>
              <td><strong>2.0%</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company C</td>
              <td>$1.00</td>
              <td>$10.00</td>
              <td><strong>10.0%</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>If you invest $10,000 in Company A, you will receive $400 in cash per year. If you invest the same amount in
          Company B, you will only receive $200. Company C offers the highest yield, but as explained below, an
          extremely high yield is often a red flag.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          Yield moves inversely to price. If a company's stock price falls by 50% but the dividend remains identical,
          the yield doubles mechanically. Therefore, high yields are often a consequence of crashing stock prices.

        <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>Dividend yields must be compared against the "risk-free rate" (like the 10-Year US Treasury yield) to
          determine if the premium is worth the equity risk.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0%:</strong> The company does not pay a dividend (common for high-growth tech firms that reinvest
            all cash).</li>
          <li><strong>1% - 3%:</strong> Typical for mature, healthy companies that also offer capital appreciation.</li>
          <li><strong>4% - 6%:</strong> Typical for slow-growing cash cows, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and
            utilities.</li>
          <li><strong>8%+ (Value Trap):</strong> Often a warning sign. The market has dumped the stock because it
            anticipates the dividend will be cut.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
        <p>The trap for amateur investors is "yield chasing"—buying a stock simply because the yield is 10%. A 10% yield
          usually indicates distress. If the company is generating poor earnings and cuts the dividend entirely, the
          investor loses their income stream and likely suffers massive capital losses when the stock dumps further.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          Never analyze dividend yield in isolation. You must check the Payout Ratio. If a company earns $1.00 per share
          but pays a $1.50 dividend, the dividend is entirely unsustainable and is being funded by debt or cash
          reserves.
