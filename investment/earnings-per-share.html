      Earnings Per Share (EPS) calculates the portion of a company's total profit allocated to a single outstanding
      share of common stock. It serves as the bedrock indicator of corporate profitability and is the foundational
      variable for almost all fundamental valuation ratios on Wall Street, most notably the P/E ratio.

        <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

        <h3>Basic Form</h3>
        <pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>Basic EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Average Outstanding Shares</code></pre>

        <p>Subtracting preferred dividends is crucial because preferred shareholders receive their payout before common
          equity holders. The <strong>Diluted EPS</strong> is functionally more accurate—it assumes all convertible
          bonds, stock options, and warrants are exercised, expanding the share pool and lowering EPS. You should
          universally use Diluted EPS.</p>

        <h3>Worked Example</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Metric</th>
              <th>2024 Result</th>
              <th>2025 Result</th>
              <th>Growth</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Net Income</td>
              <td>$100,000,000</td>
              <td>$110,000,000</td>
              <td><strong>+10%</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Shares Outstanding</td>
              <td>50,000,000</td>
              <td>45,000,000</td>
              <td><strong>-10%</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Earnings Per Share</strong></td>
              <td><strong>$2.00</strong></td>
              <td><strong>$2.44</strong></td>
              <td><strong>+22%</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Notice the magic of share buybacks. The company's raw profit (Net Income) only grew by 10%. But because the
          company aggressively bought back its own stock and reduced the share count by 10%, the EPS shot up by 22%.
          From an investor's perspective holding a single share, the value generated by the company jumped massively.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          EPS on its own means nothing. A $10.00 EPS is not "better" than a $2.00 EPS. EPS is a completely arbitrary
          number dictated by how many shares the founder decided to issue at IPO. What matters is the
          <strong>Direction</strong> (is it growing?) and the <strong>Ratio</strong> against the stock price (the P/E
          ratio).

        <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>Wall Street runs on quarterly EPS expectations (“earnings beats” vs “earnings misses”).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A company trading at $50/share earning $1 EPS this year must show a pathway to $2, $3, or $5 EPS in the
            future, or the high valuation will violently correct.</li>
          <li><strong>Negative EPS:</strong> The company is losing money. Very common for early-stage software and
            biotech firms. When EPS is negative, investors default to Price-to-Sales (P/S) metrics to value the company.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
        <p>EPS is the easiest number for accounting departments to legally manipulate. A CEO desperate to hit their Wall
          Street EPS growth target can:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Aggressively buy back stock with debt to shrink the denominator.</li>
          <li>Sell off physical assets, creating a one-time spike in Net Income.</li>
          <li>Delay essential R&D expenses into the next quarter.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          Net Income (the top half of EPS) is an accounting abstraction filled with depreciation, amortization, and
          non-cash items. Always verify that EPS growth is backed up by true Free Cash Flow growth.
