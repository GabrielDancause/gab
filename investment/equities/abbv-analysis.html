  <div class="doc-abstract">
    AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. It is best known for Humira, the world's best-selling drug for nearly a decade. AbbVie has since diversified its portfolio through the acquisition of Allergan and the development of new blockbusters in immunology and oncology. It is a "Dividend King," recognized for its reliable cash flows and shareholder returns.

      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>AbbVie operates as a single global business with a focus on four primary therapeutic areas. The integration of Allergan in 2020 significantly expanded its portfolio into aesthetics and neuroscience.</p>

      <h3>Immunology</h3>
      <p>The core powerhouse. This segment includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Humira:</strong> Once the primary revenue driver, now facing biosimilar competition. Sales are declining but remain significant.</li>
        <li><strong>Skyrizi & Rinvoq:</strong> The successors. These newer drugs are rapidly growing and are projected to eventually surpass Humira's peak revenue combined.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Oncology</h3>
      <p>A key growth driver focusing on blood cancers. Major drugs include <strong>Imbruvica</strong> and <strong>Venclexta</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Neuroscience</h3>
      <p>Treatments for migraine, Parkinson's, and psychiatric disorders. Key products include <strong>Botox Therapeutic</strong>, <strong>Vraylar</strong>, and <strong>Qulipta</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
      <p>Acquired via Allergan. This cash-pay (non-insurance) business includes <strong>Botox Cosmetic</strong> and the <strong>Juvederm</strong> collection of fillers.</p>

      <h3>Competitive Moat</h3>
      <p>AbbVie possesses a "Wide Moat" characterized by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> A fortress of patents protecting key drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, extending exclusivity well into the 2030s.</li>
        <li><strong>High Switching Costs:</strong> Particularly in aesthetics (Botox), where brand loyalty and physician training create significant barriers to entry.</li>
        <li><strong>R&D Scale:</strong> Billions in annual R&D spending ensure a continuous pipeline of next-generation therapies to replace aging blockbusters.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Cash Flow & Dividends</h3>
      <p>AbbVie is a "Dividend King," having raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott). The company generates massive free cash flow, which supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A high dividend payout ratio.</li>
        <li>Debt reduction (deleveraging from the Allergan acquisition).</li>
        <li>Continued R&D investment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~70%
Operating Margin:  ~35%
Net Margin:        ~15-20% (varies with write-offs)

Key Driver: High margins in immunology and aesthetics provide a cushion
against patent expiries.</code></pre>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>AbbVie typically trades at a discount to the broader market and high-growth tech stocks, reflecting the risks inherent in the pharmaceutical industry (patent cliffs, regulation).</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>12x – 18x</td><td>Value territory. Low multiple reflects patent risks.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>3.0% – 4.5%</td><td>High yield attractive to income investors.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>FCF Yield</strong></td><td>6% – 8%</td><td>Strong cash generation relative to market cap.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>ROE</strong></td><td>> 50%</td><td>Exceptionally high due to buybacks and leverage.</td></tr>
        </tbody>

        Valuation is heavily influenced by the "Humira Cliff." Investors are watching how effectively Skyrizi and Rinvoq offset the decline of Humira revenues.

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Patent Cliff (LOE)</h3>
      <p>Loss of Exclusivity (LOE) is the biggest risk. Humira lost US patent protection in 2023, leading to an influx of cheaper biosimilars and a sharp decline in revenue for that drug.</p>

      <h3>Drug Pricing Regulation</h3>
      <p>The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allows Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-spend drugs. Imbruvica has already been selected for negotiation, and others may follow.</p>

      <h3>Pipeline Execution</h3>
      <p>Pharmaceutical companies must constantly invent new drugs to replace aging ones. Failures in clinical trials can severely impact future growth prospects.</p>
