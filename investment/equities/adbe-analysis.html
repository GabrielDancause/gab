      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Adobe's business is structured around three key growth pillars. The transition from perpetual licenses to a subscription-based model (SaaS) has been a major driver of recurring revenue and stability.</p>

      <h3>Digital Media</h3>
      <p>The core of Adobe's business, accounting for over 70% of revenue. This segment includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creative Cloud:</strong> The industry standard for creative professionals. Includes flagship products like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and the new Firefly generative AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Document Cloud:</strong> Centered around the PDF format, which Adobe invented. Includes Acrobat and Adobe Sign for digital document workflows and e-signatures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Digital Experience</h3>
      <p>Focused on enterprise customers, this segment provides a comprehensive suite for marketing, analytics, advertising, and commerce. It competes with Salesforce, Oracle, and others to help businesses manage customer journeys and data.</p>

      <h3>Publishing and Advertising</h3>
      <p>A smaller, legacy segment that includes eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, and web conferencing.</p>

      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>SaaS Economics</h3>
      <p>Adobe exemplifies the power of the Software-as-a-Service model. With high gross margins and recurring revenue, it generates substantial free cash flow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recurring Revenue:</strong> The vast majority of revenue comes from subscriptions, providing predictability.</li>
        <li><strong>High Margins:</strong> Gross margins are consistently around 88%, reflecting the scalability of software.</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Allocation:</strong> Adobe uses its cash flow to acquire strategic assets (e.g., Figma attempt, Frame.io) and return capital to shareholders through share buybacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~88%
Operating Margin:  ~37%
Net Margin:        ~30%

Key Driver: Pricing power and cross-selling within the Creative
and Document Clouds continue to drive margin expansion.</code></pre>

      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Adobe typically trades at a premium valuation due to its dominant market position and high profitability. However, concerns over AI disruption can lead to volatility in its multiple.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>25x – 35x</td><td>Reflects high quality and consistent double-digit growth.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>PEG Ratio</strong></td><td>1.5 – 2.0</td><td>Premium valuation relative to growth, justified by moat.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>FCF Yield</strong></td><td>3% – 4%</td><td>Healthy yield for a growth technology stock.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        When valuing Adobe, watch the "Net New ARR" (Annualized Recurring Revenue) metric closely. It is a leading indicator of future growth health.

      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Generative AI Disruption</h3>
      <p>The rise of generative AI (e.g., Midjourney, OpenAI's Sora) poses a potential existential threat. If AI tools can generate high-quality content without Adobe's complex software, the barrier to entry for creativity lowers significantly. Adobe is mitigating this by integrating its own "Firefly" AI directly into its tools.</p>

      <h3>Competition</h3>
      <p>Competitors like <strong>Canva</strong> have successfully captured the lower-end, non-professional market with easy-to-use web-based tools. While Adobe Express competes here, Canva remains a strong challenger. In the UI/UX space, <strong>Figma</strong> remains a formidable competitor after Adobe's acquisition attempt was blocked by regulators.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Sensitivity</h3>
      <p>With a P/E often exceeding 30x, Adobe's stock is sensitive to interest rates and any slowdown in growth. The market expects flawless execution.</p>
