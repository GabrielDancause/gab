      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>AES operates as a diversified power generation and utility company with a global footprint. Its business is transitioning rapidly towards clean energy solutions.</p>

      <h3>Key Segments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Renewables:</strong> A rapidly growing segment comprising solar, wind, and energy storage projects. AES is a leader in corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), securing long-term contracts with major corporations like Google and Microsoft.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Includes regulated electric utilities in the US (AES Indiana, AES Ohio) and El Salvador. These provide stable, regulated cash flows that support the company's dividend.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Infrastructure:</strong> Comprises natural gas and LNG facilities, primarily in Latin America (Panama, Dominican Republic) and Vietnam. This segment provides critical baseload power and grid stability.</li>
        <li><strong>New Energy Technologies:</strong> Includes <strong>Fluence</strong>, a joint venture with Siemens. Fluence is a leading global provider of energy storage products and services, positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for grid flexibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Competitive Moat</h3>
      <p>AES possesses a <strong>Narrow Moat</strong> derived from two primary sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulated Assets:</strong> Its utility businesses in Indiana and Ohio operate as government-sanctioned monopolies, providing a guaranteed rate of return on equity (ROE) and protecting it from competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Contracts:</strong> The renewable energy segment relies on 15-20 year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with creditworthy counterparties. These contracts lock in revenue and shield the company from short-term wholesale price volatility.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Revenue & Growth</h3>
      <p>AES generates revenue from a mix of regulated utilities and competitive power generation businesses. Growth is driven by the expansion of its renewable portfolio and modernization of its utility infrastructure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographic Diversification:</strong> Revenue is spread across the US, South America (Chile, Colombia, Brazil), MCAC (Mexico, Central America, Caribbean), and Eurasia.</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Allocation:</strong> The company is investing heavily in renewables, targeting significant capacity additions over the coming years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Dividends</h3>
      <p>AES is a consistent dividend payer, often yielding around 3-4%. The dividend is supported by stable cash flows from its regulated businesses and long-term contracts.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>AES typically trades at a discount to fully regulated US utilities due to its exposure to competitive markets and foreign currency risks in Latin America.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>10x – 15x</td><td>Generally lower than pure-play regulated utilities (often 18-20x).</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>3.5% – 4.5%</td><td>Attractive for income-focused investors.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Price-to-Book</strong></td><td>~2.5x – 3.0x</td><td>Reflects the asset-heavy nature of the business.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Free Cash Flow</strong></td><td>Often Negative</td><td>Reflects heavy capital expenditure (CapEx) in renewable growth projects.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Leverage</h3>
      <p>Like many utilities, AES carries a significant debt load to fund capital-intensive projects. Rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs and pressure earnings.</p>

      <h3>Foreign Exchange (FX)</h3>
      <p>With substantial operations in South America and other international markets, AES is exposed to currency fluctuations. A strengthening US dollar can reduce the reported value of international earnings.</p>

      <h3>Execution Risk</h3>
      <p>The transition from coal to renewables involves complex project development and execution. Delays or cost overruns in major renewable projects could impact financial targets.</p>
