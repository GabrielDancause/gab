      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Aflac operates primarily through two segments. While famous in the U.S., a majority of its revenue historically comes from Japan.</p>

      <h3>Aflac Japan</h3>
      <p>The largest revenue contributor. Aflac Japan is the leading provider of medical and cancer insurance in Japan, insuring one in four households. Products include cancer insurance, medical insurance, and income support insurance.</p>

      <h3>Aflac U.S.</h3>
      <p>The U.S. segment focuses on supplemental insurance products like accident, disability, and critical illness coverage. These are primarily sold through payroll deductions at worksites, providing cash directly to policyholders to cover expenses not met by major medical insurance.</p>

      <h3>Investment Portfolio</h3>
      <p>Like all insurers, Aflac generates significant income by investing its "float" (premiums collected before claims are paid). The portfolio is predominantly composed of high-grade fixed-income securities, providing a steady stream of investment income.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Dividend Aristocrat</h3>
      <p>Aflac has a remarkable track record of increasing its dividend for over 40 consecutive years, making it a favorite among income investors. The company prioritizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>

      <h3>Margins & Profitability</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Operating Margin:  ~20%
ROE:               ~10-15%
Net Margin:        ~15-20%

Key Driver: Investment income and disciplined underwriting
are the main drivers of profitability.</code></pre>

      <h3>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</h3>
      <p>Aflac is a cash machine. The company consistently generates strong free cash flow, often exceeding net income. This excess cash is used to fund its dividend and repurchase shares, reducing the share count by over 40% in the last decade.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Aflac typically trades at a lower P/E multiple compared to the broader market, reflecting the mature nature of the insurance industry and interest rate sensitivity.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>

          <tr><td><strong>Price/Book</strong></td><td>1.0x – 1.5x</td><td>Standard valuation range for insurers.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>FCF Yield</strong></td><td>8% – 12%</td><td>Extremely high yield indicating strong value.</td></tr>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        When valuing Aflac, pay attention to the Yen/Dollar exchange rate. A weaker Yen can optically reduce earnings when translated back to USD, even if the underlying business in Japan is performing well.

      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Interest Rate Risk</h3>
      <p>Aflac holds a massive bond portfolio. Higher interest rates can lead to unrealized losses on the bond portfolio (reducing book value), although they allow new premiums to be invested at higher yields.</p>

      <h3>Currency Risk (JPY/USD)</h3>
      <p>With a significant portion of earnings coming from Japan, Aflac is sensitive to currency fluctuations. The company uses hedging strategies to mitigate this, but it remains a key factor.</p>

      <h3>Regulatory Risk</h3>
      <p>Changes in healthcare laws or insurance regulations in either the U.S. or Japan could impact the demand for supplemental insurance products.</p>
