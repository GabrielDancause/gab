  <div class="doc-abstract">
    American International Group (AIG) is a leading global insurance organization. Following a multi-year restructuring, AIG has pivoted from a sprawling conglomerate to a focused Property & Casualty (P&C) underwriter. By divesting its life and retirement business (Corebridge Financial), AIG aims to reduce volatility and improve return on equity through disciplined underwriting and operational efficiency.

      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>AIG operates primarily as a commercial and personal insurer. Its business is now streamlined into General Insurance, focusing on underwriting profitability.</p>

      <h3>General Insurance Segments</h3>
      <p>The core business is divided into three key reportable segments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>North America Commercial:</strong> Provides property, casualty, and financial lines insurance to businesses in the U.S. and Canada.</li>
        <li><strong>International Commercial:</strong> Offers similar commercial products globally, leveraging AIG's extensive international footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Personal:</strong> Includes personal accident, travel, and high-net-worth personal lines insurance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other Operations</h3>
      <p>This segment includes the company's remaining stake in <strong>Corebridge Financial</strong> (formerly Life & Retirement) and run-off portfolios. The strategic goal is to fully exit non-core businesses to simplify the valuation story.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Underwriting Discipline</h3>
      <p>The key metric for AIG's turnaround is the <strong>Combined Ratio</strong> (Losses + Expenses / Earned Premiums). A ratio below 100% indicates underwriting profit. AIG has significantly improved this metric, targeting sub-90% levels in its commercial lines.</p>

      <h3>Capital Management</h3>
      <p>AIG returns significant capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks and dividends. The divestiture of Corebridge has provided excess capital to fuel these returns.</p>

      <h3>AIG Next</h3>
      <p>The "AIG Next" program is an operational efficiency initiative designed to reduce the company's absolute expense base, further supporting margin expansion.</p>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Insurers are typically valued on P/E and Price-to-Book (P/B). AIG has historically traded at a discount to peers due to its complex legacy and past volatility.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>10x – 15x</td><td>Lower than the broader market, reflecting the cyclical nature of insurance.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Price-to-Book (P/B)</strong></td><td>0.8x – 1.2x</td><td>Often trades near book value. A key measure of asset backing.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>ROE</strong></td><td>8% – 12%</td><td>Improving ROE is the primary catalyst for multiple expansion.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        When analyzing AIG, pay attention to "Adjusted Book Value Per Share," which often excludes AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income) to remove the noise from unrealized bond portfolio fluctuations.

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Catastrophe (CAT) Risk</h3>
      <p>As a global P&C insurer, AIG is exposed to natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes. While reinsurance programs mitigate this, severe CAT years can erode earnings.</p>

      <h3>Reserving Adequacy</h3>
      <p>Long-tail liability lines (like casualty insurance) face the risk of "social inflation"—rising litigation costs and jury verdicts. If past reserves prove insufficient, AIG may need to take charges to strengthen them.</p>

      <h3>Investment Portfolio</h3>
      <p>AIG holds a vast investment portfolio. While higher interest rates generally boost investment income, they also impact the fair value of fixed-income securities and can affect commercial real estate holdings.</p>
