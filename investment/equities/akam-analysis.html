      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Akamai has transformed from a pure-play CDN provider into a diversified cloud company. Its business is now categorized into three main segments:</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>The largest and fastest-growing segment. Akamai leverages its massive edge network to stop threats before they reach the data center. Key offerings include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web App & API Protection (WAAP):</strong> Protecting applications from attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Bot Management:</strong> Distinguishing between human users and automated bots.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Trust Enterprise:</strong> Secure access solutions replacing traditional VPNs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Compute</h3>
      <p>The growth engine, bolstered by the acquisition of Linode. Akamai Connected Cloud offers a distributed alternative to centralized hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP). It focuses on workloads that benefit from being close to the user, offering lower latency and potentially lower egress costs.</p>

      <h3>Delivery</h3>
      <p>The legacy foundation. Akamai's CDN delivers a significant portion of the world's internet traffic, including video streaming, software downloads, and website content. While growth here has slowed due to DIY efforts by large tech companies, it remains a cash cow that funds expansion into Security and Compute.</p>

      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Revenue Mix Shift</h3>
      <p>The most critical aspect of the Akamai thesis is the successful shift in revenue mix. Security and Compute now account for approximately <strong>67%</strong> of total revenue, growing at double-digit rates, while the lower-margin Delivery business is flat or declining.</p>

      <h3>Margins & Cash Flow</h3>
      <p>Akamai is highly profitable with strong cash generation.</p>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~60%
Operating Margin:  ~18% (GAAP) / ~29% (Non-GAAP)
FCF Yield:         ~5%

Key Driver: As the mix shifts further toward Security (high margin)
and Compute, margins are expected to stabilize and potentially expand.</code></pre>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Akamai typically trades at a discount to high-growth SaaS and cybersecurity peers, reflecting the drag from its legacy Delivery business.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>20x – 30x</td><td>Reasonable for a company transitioning to growth.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>EV/Revenue</strong></td><td>3x – 4x</td><td>Lower than pure-play security firms (often >10x).</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>FCF Yield</strong></td><td>4% – 6%</td><td>Attractive yield for a tech company, supporting buybacks.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

        The "Sum of the Parts" argument suggests that the fast-growing Security and Compute businesses are undervalued when bundled with the slower Delivery segment.

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Hyperscaler Competition</h3>
      <p>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are formidable competitors in both Compute and Security. Akamai must differentiate with its "edge" architecture and pricing advantages (e.g., lower egress fees).</p>

      <h3>DIY Content Delivery</h3>
      <p>Large tech companies (like Apple, Netflix, Meta) have built their own CDNs to reduce costs, reducing their reliance on third-party providers like Akamai. This secular headwind limits growth in the Delivery segment.</p>

      <h3>Pricing Pressure</h3>
      <p>The CDN market is commoditized, leading to constant price erosion. Akamai offsets this by selling value-added Security services on top of delivery.</p>
