      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Albemarle operates through three primary segments, each with distinct market dynamics and growth profiles.</p>

      <h3>Energy Storage (Lithium)</h3>
      <p>The primary growth engine. Albemarle mines and converts lithium into two main forms: <strong>Lithium Carbonate</strong> and <strong>Lithium Hydroxide</strong>. These are critical components for Li-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) and consumer electronics. The company sources lithium from brine deposits in Chile (Salar de Atacama) and the U.S. (Silver Peak, NV), as well as hard rock (spodumene) mines in Australia (Greenbushes).</p>

      <h3>Specialties (Bromine)</h3>
      <p>The cash cow. Albemarle is a leading global producer of bromine-based solutions. These are used primarily as flame retardants in electronics, construction materials, and automotive components. This segment provides stable cash flows and high margins, helping to offset the volatility of the lithium business.</p>

      <h3>Ketjen (Catalysts)</h3>
      <p>This segment provides catalysts used in the refining and petrochemical industries. Products include fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts and hydroprocessing catalysts, which help refineries produce cleaner fuels and maximize yield.</p>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Cyclicality & Volatility</h3>
      <p>Albemarle's financial performance is heavily influenced by the price of lithium. The market has experienced extreme volatility, with prices skyrocketing in 2022 due to EV demand and then crashing in 2023-2024 due to oversupply and slower-than-expected adoption.</p>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~10-15% (Cyclical Low)
Operating Margin:  ~0-5% (Cyclical Low)
Net Margin:        Negative (Recent Quarters)

Key Driver: As lithium prices recover, margins are expected to expand significantly.
Cost discipline and CapEx reductions are current priorities.</code></pre>

      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Valuing a cyclical company like Albemarle requires looking beyond current depressed earnings.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Context</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>N/M</td><td>Currently not meaningful due to recent losses or suppressed earnings. Historical average is ~25x during mid-cycle.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Price/Book</strong></td><td>~1.0x - 1.5x</td><td>Trading near book value often signals a cyclical bottom for commodity producers.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>~1.5%</td><td>Albemarle is a <strong>Dividend Aristocrat</strong>, having raised its dividend for over 29 consecutive years.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        Investment Thesis: The long-term thesis rests on the secular growth of EVs. If lithium demand outpaces supply later in the decade, Albemarle's low-cost production assets positioned it to capture significant value.

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Lithium Price Volatility</h3>
      <p>The single biggest risk factor. A prolonged period of low lithium prices would severely impact profitability and cash flow, potentially threatening the dividend growth streak.</p>

      <h3>Geopolitical Risks</h3>
      <p>Operations in Chile are subject to government oversight and potential nationalization threats (though currently managed through agreements). Additionally, the global battery supply chain is heavily reliant on China, creating trade war risks.</p>

      <h3>Technology Shift</h3>
      <p>While unlikely in the near term, breakthroughs in alternative battery chemistries (e.g., Sodium-ion or solid-state batteries that use less lithium) could dampen long-term demand.</p>
