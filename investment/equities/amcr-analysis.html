      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Amcor generates revenue through two primary reporting segments, providing packaging solutions that protect products and extend shelf life.</p>

      <h3>Flexibles</h3>
      <p>The largest segment by revenue. Amcor Flexibles provides flexible packaging solutions globally. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Food & Beverage:</strong> Wrappers, pouches, and bags for fresh and processed foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Sterile packaging for medical devices and pharmaceuticals.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Care:</strong> Packaging for cosmetics and toiletries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rigid Packaging</h3>
      <p>Focused primarily on the Americas. This segment manufactures rigid containers, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beverage Containers:</strong> PET bottles for water, soda, and sports drinks (working with major brands like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola).</li>
        <li><strong>Specialty Containers:</strong> Jars and bottles for food, spirits, and home care products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Competitive Moat</h3>
      <p>Amcor possesses a narrow but durable moat driven by <strong>Economies of Scale</strong> and <strong>Switching Costs</strong>. Its global manufacturing footprint allows it to serve multinational giants (like PepsiCo and Nestlé) across all their markets, a capability few competitors can match. Furthermore, integration into customer production lines and long-term supply contracts make switching suppliers costly and operationally risky.</p>

      <h3>Stable Cash Flows</h3>
      <p>Due to the essential nature of its end markets (food, healthcare, hygiene), Amcor's demand remains relatively stable even during recessions. This predictability supports strong free cash flow generation (FCF).</p>

      <h3>Dividend Consistency</h3>
      <p>Amcor is often favored by income investors. The company has a long history of increasing its annual dividend, qualifying it as a "Dividend Aristocrat" (based on its combined history with Bemis and legacy Amcor listings). It targets a payout ratio that allows for sustainable growth while reinvesting in the business.</p>

      <h3>Margins & Pass-Throughs</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~20%
Operating Margin:  ~11%
Net Margin:        ~7%

Key Feature: Amcor uses raw material cost pass-through mechanisms
in its contracts to protect margins from volatility in resin prices.</code></pre>

      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Amcor typically trades at a valuation reflecting its status as a mature, low-growth, high-yield industrial company.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>14x – 18x</td><td>Aligned with industrial packaging peers.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>4% – 5%</td><td>Attractive yield compared to the broader market.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>FCF Yield</strong></td><td>5% – 7%</td><td>Strong cash generation supports the dividend.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        Valuation is sensitive to interest rates (as a bond proxy) and raw material cycles. The pending merger with Berry Global (announced late 2024) may impact future valuation multiples and capital structure.

      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Raw Material Costs</h3>
      <p>Fluctuations in the price of resin (derived from oil and natural gas) can impact short-term profitability, although pass-through contracts mitigate this over time.</p>

      <h3>Sustainability & Regulation</h3>
      <p>The global push against single-use plastics is a significant long-term risk. Amcor is addressing this by investing heavily in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recyclability:</strong> Aiming for all packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweighting:</strong> Reducing the amount of material used in packaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycled Content:</strong> Incorporating more PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) resin.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Foreign Exchange</h3>
      <p>As a global company reporting in USD, Amcor faces currency headwinds when the dollar strengthens against other currencies where it operates.</p>
