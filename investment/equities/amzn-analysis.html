      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Amazon operates through three primary segments, each with distinct economics. Understanding the interplay between low-margin retail and high-margin services is critical to the investment thesis.</p>

      <h3>North America & International</h3>
      <p>The retail engine. This segment includes online and physical stores.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Online Stores:</strong> Direct sales where Amazon is the seller of record. Low margins due to shipping and fulfillment costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Seller Services:</strong> Commissions, fulfillment fees (FBA), and shipping fees charged to third-party merchants. This is higher margin than direct sales.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Services:</strong> Amazon Prime fees, which lock customers into the ecosystem and drive recurring revenue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
      <p>The profit powerhouse. AWS is the world's leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure (IaaS) and platform (PaaS) services to millions of customers. AWS generates the majority of Amazon's operating income, subsidizing the expansion of the retail network.</p>

      <h3>Advertising Services</h3>
      <p>The silent giant. Amazon has built a massive advertising business by letting brands promote products directly on its search results and video platforms (Prime Video, Twitch). This segment is growing rapidly and boasts very high margins.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Cash Flow King</h3>
      <p>Amazon prioritizes <strong>Free Cash Flow per Share</strong> over earnings per share. The company famously reinvests almost all its profits back into the business—building fulfillment centers, data centers, and new technologies.</p>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~45% (rising due to services mix)
Operating Margin:  ~7% (blended)
AWS Margin:        ~30%+

Key Driver: As AWS and Advertising grow faster than retail,
Amazon's overall profitability mix improves structurally.</code></pre>

    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Amazon typically trades at high P/E multiples because its stated earnings are depressed by massive reinvestment (depreciation & amortization). Investors often look at operating cash flow or EV/EBITDA.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>40x – 60x</td><td>High, reflecting growth and reinvestment.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Price-to-Sales</strong></td><td>2.5x – 3.5x</td><td>Commonly used for the retail portion of the business.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td><td>20x – 25x</td><td>Accounts for heavy depreciation charges from infrastructure capex.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        Amazon's "flywheel" effect means that scale in one area (Retail) lowers costs, which attracts more customers, which attracts more sellers, enhancing selection and further lowering costs. AWS follows a similar loop.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Antitrust & Regulation</h3>
      <p>Regulators (FTC, EU) scrutinize Amazon for potential anti-competitive practices, such as prioritizing its own private-label products over third-party sellers or bundling services (Prime).</p>

      <h3>Cloud Competition</h3>
      <p>While AWS pioneered the cloud industry, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are fierce competitors. A slowdown in AWS growth or margin compression due to price wars is a key risk.</p>

      <h3>Capital Intensity</h3>
      <p>Amazon requires immense capital expenditure to maintain its logistics network (planes, trucks, warehouses) and data centers (chips, energy). Rising interest rates or energy costs can impact returns.</p>
