      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>A. O. Smith operates primarily through two segments: North America and Rest of World. The company manufactures residential and commercial water heaters, boilers, and water treatment products.</p>

      <h3>North America</h3>
      <p>The core profit driver. This segment accounts for approximately 75-80% of total sales and includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Heaters:</strong> A dominant market share in both residential and commercial units, marketed under brands like A. O. Smith, Lochinvar, and State.</li>
        <li><strong>Boilers:</strong> High-efficiency boilers for commercial applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Treatment:</strong> A growing portfolio of filtration and conditioning products (e.g., Aquasana).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Crucially, about 80-85% of North American water heater volume is driven by replacement demand, making revenue resilient even during economic downturns.</p>

      <h3>Rest of World (ROW)</h3>
      <p>The growth vector. Primarily focused on China and India, this segment sells water heaters, water treatment products, and air purifiers. While offering higher long-term growth potential, it is subject to greater volatility due to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors in these regions.</p>

      <h2>4.0 Competitive Moat</h2>

      <h3>Brand & Distribution</h3>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>5.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>China Exposure</h3>
      <p>A significant portion of the "Rest of World" revenue comes from China. Economic slowdowns, real estate market struggles, or geopolitical tensions in the region can negatively impact growth and earnings.</p>

      <h3>Raw Material Costs</h3>
      <p>The company is sensitive to fluctuations in the price of steel and other raw materials. While they can often pass costs to customers, rapid spikes can temporarily compress margins.</p>

      <h3>Housing Market Cyclicity</h3>
      <p>While replacement demand is steady, the ~15-20% of demand tied to new construction makes the company somewhat sensitive to interest rates and the broader housing cycle.</p>
