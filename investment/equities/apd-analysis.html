      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Air Products operates through regional industrial gas segments and a global corporate segment. The business model is characterized by long-term contracts and high switching costs, creating a stable revenue base.</p>

      <h3>Regional Segments</h3>
      <p>The core industrial gases business is organized geographically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Americas:</strong> The largest segment by revenue and profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Asia:</strong> Strong presence in China and electronics markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Mature market with focus on efficiency and decarbonization.</li>
        <li><strong>Middle East & India:</strong> High growth potential, especially with mega-projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Modes of Supply</h3>
      <p>The distribution model dictates the economics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-site / Pipeline:</strong> Gas is supplied via pipeline or a dedicated plant on the customer's site. These contracts are long-term (15-20 years) with "take-or-pay" clauses, providing utility-like stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquid Bulk:</strong> Delivered by tanker trucks to storage tanks at customer sites. Pricing is more dynamic and linked to merchant market conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaged Gases:</strong> Cylinders for smaller customers (welding, labs). Higher margin but more operationally intensive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hydrogen & Energy Transition</h3>
      <p>APD is betting big on the hydrogen economy. It is executing massive projects (e.g., NEOM in Saudi Arabia) to produce green ammonia and hydrogen, positioning itself as a first-mover in the low-carbon energy space.</p>

      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Cash Flow & Capex</h3>
      <p>Historically a strong free cash flow generator, Air Products has recently ramped up capital expenditure significantly to fund its clean energy projects. This has temporarily depressed free cash flow, but management expects high returns on invested capital (ROIC) once these projects come online.</p>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~30%
Operating Margin:  ~23%
Net Margin:        ~18%

Key Driver: Operational efficiency (productivity programs) and
pricing power in the oligopolistic industrial gas market.</code></pre>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Air Products typically trades at a premium to the broader market due to its defensive characteristics (long-term contracts) and growth potential in hydrogen.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>20x – 28x</td><td>Reflects quality and growth optionality.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>2.0% – 3.0%</td><td>Dividend Aristocrat with over 40 years of consecutive increases.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td><td>12x – 16x</td><td>Standard valuation multiple for capital-intensive industrial businesses.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

        Valuation is currently a tug-of-war between the stability of the legacy gas business and the execution risk/reward of the new hydrogen mega-projects.

      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Project Execution</h3>
      <p>The company is undertaking some of the largest engineering projects in its history (e.g., NEOM, Louisiana Clean Energy Complex). Delays or cost overruns could weigh on returns and investor sentiment.</p>

      <h3>Geopolitics & Energy Prices</h3>
      <p>Significant exposure to China and the Middle East introduces geopolitical risk. Additionally, natural gas is a key feedstock for hydrogen production; while costs are often passed through to on-site customers, volatility can impact the merchant business.</p>

      <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
      <p>As a capital-intensive business with significant debt to fund growth, higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, potentially compressing the spread between ROIC and WACC.</p>
