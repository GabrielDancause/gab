      <h2>1.0 Business Model</h2>
      <p>Alphabet's business model is primarily an advertising ecosystem fueled by data and reach, though it is rapidly diversifying into cloud computing and subscriptions.</p>

      <h3>The Flywheel Effect</h3>
      <p>Google provides free, best-in-class utility services (Search, Maps, Gmail, Android, Chrome) to billions of users. In exchange, users provide intent signals and attention, which Google monetizes through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Advertising:</strong> Ads triggered by user queries (Search). High intent, high conversion, high pricing power.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand Advertising:</strong> Awareness campaigns on YouTube and the Google Display Network.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Revenue Segments</h2>
      <p>Alphabet reports revenue in three main categories. Understanding the growth profile of each is critical.</p>

      <h3>1. Google Services (The Cash Cow)</h3>
      <p>This segment generates the bulk of revenue and almost all operating profit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Search & Other:</strong> The core profit engine. Growth tracks with e-commerce and digital ad spend.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube Ads:</strong> Driven by engagement and the shift of ad budgets from TV to digital video.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Network:</strong> Revenue from ads served on non-Google properties (AdSense/AdMob).</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices:</strong> Includes YouTube Premium/Music, YouTube TV, Google One storage, Play Store fees, and Pixel hardware. This is a fast-growing, non-advertising revenue stream.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Google Cloud (The Growth Engine)</h3>
      <p>Google Cloud (GCP) and Google Workspace are enterprise-facing. GCP is the third-largest public cloud provider, offering compute, storage, and advanced AI/ML capabilities. It has shifted from an investment phase to a profitability phase, contributing positively to operating income.</p>

      <h3>3. Other Bets (The Optionality)</h3>
      <p>Long-term moonshot projects like Waymo (autonomous driving) and Verily. While currently loss-making, they represent significant potential future value disconnected from the ad market.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Key Metrics</h2>

      <h3>Price-to-Earnings (P/E)</h3>
      <p>Google typically trades at a P/E multiple of <strong>20x–25x</strong>. This is often lower than peers like Microsoft, reflecting "regulatory discount" and concerns over search monopoly durability. A P/E below 20x has historically been a strong buying opportunity.</p>

      <h3>Return on Equity (ROE)</h3>
      <p>Google boasts an ROE consistently around <strong>25%–30%</strong>. This indicates exceptional efficiency in generating profit from shareholder capital, driven by its asset-light software model and dominant market position.</p>

      <h3>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</h3>
      <p>Alphabet is one of the world's most prolific generators of Free Cash Flow. This FCF allows for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aggressive R&D spending (over $40B/year) to maintain technical leadership.</li>
        <li>Massive share repurchases (often reducing share count by 2-3% annually).</li>
        <li>Strategic acquisitions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Competitive Moat</h2>
      <p>Alphabet possesses a wide, durable economic moat derived from several sources:</p>

      <h3>Network Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> More searches lead to better data, which improves the algorithm, leading to better results and more users.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> More creators attract more viewers, which increases ad revenue, attracting more creators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Switching Costs</h3>
      <p>The Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Android) creates high friction for users to leave. In the enterprise, migrating off Google Cloud is technically complex and costly.</p>

      <h3>Data Advantage</h3>
      <p>Decades of indexing the web and user behavior provide an unrivaled dataset for training AI models and targeting advertisements.</p>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>5.0 Risk Factors</h2>

      <h3>Regulatory & Antitrust</h3>
      <p>Google faces constant scrutiny regarding its Search monopoly and Ad Tech stack. The DOJ's lawsuits pose real risks, potentially forcing the divestiture of parts of the business or banning exclusive default search agreements (e.g., with Apple).</p>

      <h3>Generative AI Disruption</h3>
      <p>The rise of LLMs (like OpenAI's ChatGPT) threatens the traditional "10 blue links" search model. If users turn to chatbots for answers, Google's ad inventory could shrink. However, Google is aggressively integrating AI (Gemini) into its own products to defend this territory.</p>

      <h3>Cyclicality</h3>
      <p>Advertising is cyclical. In a recession, ad spend is often the first budget cut, which would temporarily impact Google's top-line growth.</p>
