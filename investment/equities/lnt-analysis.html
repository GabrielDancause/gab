      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Alliant Energy operates as a fully regulated utility, meaning its rates and returns are determined by the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). This regulatory framework provides predictable, though capped, returns.</p>

      <h3>Electric Utility</h3>
      <p>The primary driver of the business, generating approximately <strong>85% of earnings</strong>. Alliant is actively transitioning its generation portfolio away from coal and toward wind and solar under its "Clean Energy Blueprint." This transition not only reduces carbon emissions but also grows the rate base through capital investment.</p>

      <h3>Gas Utility</h3>
      <p>Generates approximately <strong>15% of earnings</strong>. This segment focuses on natural gas distribution and infrastructure modernization in Iowa and Wisconsin.</p>

      <h3>Competitive Moat</h3>
      <p>As a regulated monopoly, Alliant Energy benefits from exclusive service territories, creating a significant barrier to entry. Its moat is reinforced by the capital-intensive nature of utility infrastructure and economies of scale.</p>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Earnings Growth</h3>
      <p>Management targets a long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of <strong>5-7%</strong>. This growth is primarily driven by rate base expansion—investing capital into renewable energy projects and grid modernization, which allows the company to earn a regulated return on a larger asset base.</p>

      <h3>Dividends</h3>
      <p>Alliant Energy is a "Dividend Achiever," having increased its dividend for over 20 consecutive years. The company targets a payout ratio of <strong>60-70%</strong>, which is considered safe and sustainable for a regulated utility. This makes LNT attractive for income-focused investors.</p>

      <h3>Margins & Returns</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Operating Margin:  ~23%
Net Margin:        ~16%
ROE (Authorized):  ~9.5% - 10.0%

Key Driver: Regulatory lag (the time between spending capital and recovering it through rates)
can impact realized ROE, but constructive regulation in IA/WI helps mitigate this.</code></pre>

      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>Utilities are often valued as "bond proxies" due to their stable cash flows and dividends. LNT typically trades at a slight premium to the sector average due to its favorable regulatory jurisdictions and renewable growth pipeline.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>16x – 20x</td><td>Consistent with high-quality regulated utilities.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>3.0% – 4.0%</td><td>Competitive with investment-grade corporate bonds.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Price / Book</strong></td><td>1.8x – 2.2x</td><td>Reflects the value of the regulated asset base.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        When valuing LNT, pay close attention to the "Yield Spread"—the difference between LNT's dividend yield and the 10-Year Treasury yield. A wider spread makes the stock more attractive relative to risk-free bonds.

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Regulatory Risk</h3>
      <p>The most significant risk for any utility. Adverse rulings from the IUB or PSCW regarding allowed ROE, capital structure, or cost recovery can directly impact earnings. Fortunately, both Iowa and Wisconsin are generally considered constructive regulatory environments.</p>

      <h3>Interest Rate Sensitivity</h3>
      <p>Utilities are capital-intensive and carry significant debt. Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs, potentially compressing margins. Additionally, high rates make "risk-free" Treasury bonds more attractive relative to utility dividends, putting downward pressure on the stock price.</p>

      <h3>Renewable Execution</h3>
      <p>The "Clean Energy Blueprint" involves massive capital deployment into solar and wind projects. Delays, cost overruns, or supply chain issues could hinder the company's ability to grow its rate base as projected.</p>
