      <h2>1.0 Business Overview</h2>

      <p>Following the spin-off of its Health Care business in 2024, 3M now operates through three primary business segments. The company leverages its fundamental technology platforms (like adhesives, abrasives, and films) across these segments.</p>

      <h3>Safety & Industrial</h3>
      <p>The largest segment by revenue. It serves global industrial markets and includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Abrasives & Adhesives:</strong> Industrial tapes, glues, and grinding wheels used in manufacturing.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Safety:</strong> Respiratory protection (N95 masks), hearing protection, and fall protection equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Automotive Aftermarket:</strong> Products for collision repair and car care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Transportation & Electronics</h3>
      <p>Focuses on advanced materials for high-tech applications. Key areas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Electronics Materials:</strong> Solutions for semiconductor manufacturing and display materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Automotive & Aerospace:</strong> Electrification solutions (battery materials) and commercial solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial Solutions:</strong> Reflective traffic signage and graphics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consumer</h3>
      <p>Home to iconic brands found in households worldwide. This segment includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home Improvement:</strong> Command™ hooks, Filtrete™ filters, and Scotch™ painter's tape.</li>
        <li><strong>Stationery & Office:</strong> Post-it® Notes and Scotch® tapes.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Care:</strong> Scotch-Brite™ cleaning products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2.0 Financial Performance</h2>

      <h3>Capital Allocation & Dividend</h3>
      <p>3M was historically a "Dividend King" with over 60 years of consecutive increases. However, the spin-off of Solventum led to a "dividend reset" to align the payout with the new company's earnings power. Despite the cut, 3M remains committed to a competitive dividend yield.</p>

      <h3>Restructuring</h3>
      <p>The company is executing a significant restructuring plan to simplify its supply chain and reduce management layers. The goal is to improve operating leverage and return to organic growth.</p>

      <h3>Margins</h3>
<pre><code><span class="code-label">reference</span>Gross Margin:      ~42%
Operating Margin:  ~20-22%
Net Margin:        ~15%

Key Driver: Margin expansion depends on successful execution of restructuring
and volume recovery in cyclical industrial end-markets.</code></pre>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>3.0 Valuation</h2>

      <p>3M has traded at a historical discount to its industrial peers due to the "litigation overhang." As these legal uncertainties are resolved, the valuation multiple may expand.</p>

      <h3>Valuation Metrics</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Typical Range</th><th>Interpretation</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td><strong>P/E Ratio</strong></td><td>12x – 18x</td><td>Discounted relative to high-quality industrials (often 20x+).</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>PEG Ratio</strong></td><td>1.5 – 2.0</td><td>Reflects low organic growth expectations.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td><td>2.5% – 3.0%</td><td>Attractive yield, though lower than pre-spin levels.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <div class="callout callout-note">
        When valuing 3M, focus on "Adjusted EPS" and "Adjusted FCF" which exclude the massive one-time charges related to legal settlements (PFAS, Earplugs).

    </section>

    <section class="doc-section">
      <h2>4.0 Risks</h2>

      <h3>Litigation (The "Overhang")</h3>
      <p>Two major legal issues have dominated the 3M narrative for years:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PFAS ("Forever Chemicals"):</strong> Settlements regarding the contamination of public water systems. While settlements have been reached (multi-billion dollar payouts), payments are spread over many years.</li>
        <li><strong>Combat Arms Earplugs:</strong> Settlement regarding allegations of defective earplugs supplied to the US military.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These liabilities are now "known quantities" rather than open-ended risks, but they will consume significant cash flow for the next decade.</p>

      <h3>Cyclicality</h3>
      <p>3M is heavily exposed to the general industrial economy (short-cycle industrial). An economic slowdown directly impacts demand for abrasives, adhesives, and electronics materials.</p>
