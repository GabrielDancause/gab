      The Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio compares a company's current market capitalization to its book value (its total
      assets minus total liabilities). It is an old-school value investing metric designed to determine if you are
      paying too much for what the company would theoretically be worth if it were liquidated and all its debts paid off
      today.

        <h2>1.0 The Formula</h2>

        <h3>Basic Form</h3>
        <pre><code><span class="code-label">formula</span>P/B = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities</code></pre>

        <p>The <strong>Book Value</strong> is essentially the net asset value of a company. If a company sold off all
          its factories, inventory, and cash to pay off every single debt it owed, the Book Value is what would be left
          over for shareholders. P/B asks how much a stock market investor must pay to "buy" $1 of that net asset value.
        </p>

        <h3>Worked Example</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Company</th>
              <th>Price per Share</th>
              <th>Book Value per Share</th>
              <th>P/B Ratio</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Company A (Bank)</td>
              <td>$50.00</td>
              <td>$50.00</td>
              <td><strong>1.0x</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company B (Steel)</td>
              <td>$20.00</td>
              <td>$30.00</td>
              <td><strong>0.66x</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Company C (Software)</td>
              <td>$150.00</td>
              <td>$15.00</td>
              <td><strong>10.0x</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Company B is trading below its book value (P/B of 0.66). Theoretically, you are buying the company for less
          than its component parts are worth. Company C trades at 10x its book value, because its real value lies in
          software code and brand power, which do not show up accurately on the balance sheet.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-note">
          Traditional value investors (like Benjamin Graham) hunted obsessively for stocks trading at a P/B under 1.0,
          viewing the book value as a hard floor for the stock price.

        <h2>2.0 Interpretation & Edge Cases</h2>

        <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
        <p>A "good" P/B ratio depends entirely on the industry. It is most effectively used on balance sheet-heavy
          financial institutions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>P/B < 1.0:</strong> The company is either severely undervalued or it is a "value trap" with toxic,
                overstated assets on its balance sheet that are about to be written down.</li>
          <li><strong>P/B ~ 1.0 - 2.0:</strong> Normal range for banks and capital-intensive traditional businesses.
          </li>
          <li><strong>P/B > 5.0+:</strong> Common in tech, consulting, and service industries where capital assets
            aren't required to generate massive cash flows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When it Fails (Pitfalls)</h3>
        <p>The P/B ratio is nearly useless for modern technology companies. A company like Microsoft or Google derives
          its immense value from intellectual property, patents, algorithms, and brand loyalty. The accounting rules
          dictating "Book Value" do not adequately capture these intangible assets. Consequently, applying P/B to a
          software stock will make it look monstrously overvalued, missing the entire point.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warn">
          Beware of intangible assets like "Goodwill" inflating the Book Value. Many analysts use
          <strong>Price-to-Tangible Book Value (PTBV)</strong> instead, which strips out goodwill and patents to look
          purely at hard assets.
