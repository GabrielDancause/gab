## Recording Tips

1. **Hook in the first 2 seconds** — Start talking immediately. No intros. First sentence = most attention-grabbing line.
2. **Add captions in editing** — Use CapCut or Instagram's auto-captions. 80% of people watch without sound.
3. **Look at the lens, not the screen** — Eye contact builds trust.
4. **Energy matters more than perfection** — Don't read robotically. Talk like you're telling a friend. Mess up? Keep going. It feels more real.
5. **Keep your hands visible** — Point, count on fingers, gesture. Movement keeps attention.
6. **Film all 10 in one session** — Same outfit, same lighting, same spot. Batch it. Takes about 30 minutes total.
7. **Trim ruthlessly in editing** — Cut every pause, every "um," every dead second. Reels should feel fast.
8. **Trending audio** — After recording, add a quiet trending background track in CapCut/Instagram. Helps the algorithm.
9. **Pin your best performer** — Whichever reel gets the most saves/shares, pin it to your profile grid.
10. **Story repost** — Every reel goes to Stories with a "Link in bio" sticker the same day.
