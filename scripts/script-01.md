## INTRO — WHO I AM AND WHY YOU SHOULD LISTEN

1. [SHOW: Gab's hotel website, fully loaded, on desktop]
2. Hey, what's up. I'm Gab.
3. I run a hotel in Quebec — over 60 rooms, restaurant, the whole thing.
4. [BEAT]
5. And this website you're looking at right now? I built it myself.
6. No developer. No agency. No monthly fees.
7. [SCROLL slowly through the hotel site]
8. And I'm not a tech person. I don't have a computer science degree.
9. I just figured out a way to do this that's honestly kind of unfair.
10. [BEAT]
11. And that's what I'm gonna teach you.

## THE END RESULT — WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

12. [SHOW: The finished course demo site on desktop — full page scroll]
13. So by the end of this course, you're gonna have something like this.
14. A real website. Live on the internet. With your own URL.
15. [SCROLL through the demo site slowly]
16. Multiple pages. Clean design. Looks like you paid someone two grand for it.
17. [SHOW: Demo site on mobile — resize browser or show phone mockup]
18. And it works on phones too. Perfectly.
19. [BEAT]
20. This isn't some janky template. This is a proper site.
21. And the best part? It costs you zero dollars a month to keep it live.
22. [PAUSE]
23. Zero.

## WHY NOT WIX / SQUARESPACE / WORDPRESS

24. [SHOW: Split screen — Wix pricing page on one side, Squarespace pricing on the other]
25. Now, I know what you're thinking. "Gab, why wouldn't I just use Wix or Squarespace?"
26. And look — those are fine tools. I'm not gonna trash them.
27. But here's what nobody tells you.
28. [BEAT]
29. [SHOW: Wix pricing page, highlight the monthly cost]
30. Wix starts at like sixteen bucks a month. Squarespace is similar.
31. That's almost two hundred dollars a year. Just to keep your site online.
32. [SHOW: WordPress.org homepage]
33. WordPress? You need hosting. You need to deal with plugins. Updates. Security patches.
34. It's a part-time job.
35. [BEAT]
36. [SHOW: Simple text on screen — "$0/month"]
37. What I'm gonna show you costs zero per month. Not "free tier with ads." Actually zero.
38. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Faster. Simpler. Yours."]
39. It loads faster. You own every piece of it. And once it's up, there's nothing to maintain.
40. No updates to install. No plugins to break. No subscription to cancel.
41. [BEAT]
42. You just... have a website. That works.

## THE TWO TOOLS — CLAUDE CODE + GITHUB PAGES

43. [SHOW: Terminal window with Claude Code running]
44. Okay so here's how this works. Two tools. That's it.
45. [BEAT]
46. Tool number one: Claude Code.
47. [SHOW: Claude Code in terminal — a prompt waiting for input]
48. Claude Code is an AI that lives in your terminal.
49. You know the terminal? That black screen with the blinking cursor that looks like a hacker movie?
50. [BEAT]
51. Yeah, that. Don't worry, it's not scary. I promise.
52. [SHOW: Someone typing a plain English sentence into Claude Code]
53. You just describe what you want in plain English.
54. Like, "Build me a homepage with a hero section and a contact form."
55. And it writes the code. Real code. Production-ready code.
56. [SHOW: Claude Code generating HTML/CSS in real time]
57. You don't need to understand the code. You just need to describe what you want.
58. That's it. That's the whole skill.
59. [BEAT]
60. [SHOW: GitHub Pages homepage]
61. Tool number two: GitHub Pages.
62. GitHub is where developers store their code. You've probably heard of it.
63. GitHub Pages is a free feature that takes your code and turns it into a live website.
64. [SHOW: A GitHub repository, then the live site it produces]
65. You put your files there, and boom — live website. Free hosting. Free URL. Free everything.
66. [BEAT]
67. So the workflow is simple. You talk to Claude Code. It writes your site. You push it to GitHub. GitHub makes it live.
68. That's the whole course.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

69. [SHOW: Simple checklist appearing on screen, one item at a time]
70. Alright, let's talk about what you need to get started.
71. [SHOW: Checklist item 1 — Computer icon]
72. A computer. Mac or Windows, doesn't matter. If it's from the last ten years, you're fine.
73. [SHOW: Checklist item 2 — Wi-Fi icon]
74. An internet connection. Obviously.
75. [SHOW: Checklist item 3 — Clock icon showing ~2 hours]
76. About two hours of your time. Maybe less if you're quick.
77. [SHOW: Checklist item 4 — Anthropic logo]
78. An Anthropic account. That's the company behind Claude Code. We'll set that up in the next module.
79. [SHOW: Checklist item 5 — GitHub logo]
80. And a GitHub account. Also free. Also setting that up next.
81. [BEAT]
82. That's it. Five things. You probably already have three of them.

## WHAT YOU'LL HAVE BY THE END

83. [SHOW: Demo site again — this time cycling through all the pages]
84. So let me tell you exactly what you'll walk away with.
85. [SHOW: Homepage of demo site]
86. A multi-page website. Not just one page — a real site with a homepage, an about page, whatever you need.
87. [SHOW: Demo site with clean typography and layout]
88. Professional design. Clean. Modern. The kind of thing that makes people take you seriously.
89. [SHOW: Demo site being resized from desktop to mobile, fluid transition]
90. Fully mobile responsive. Looks perfect on a phone, a tablet, a giant monitor. Everything.
91. [SHOW: Browser URL bar showing the live site URL]
92. A live URL you can share with anyone. Put it on your business card. Send it to your mom. It's real.
93. [BEAT]
94. [SHOW: Browser URL bar — yourname.github.io]
95. Your URL will be something like yourname.github.io. And if you want a custom domain later, like yourname.com, you can do that too.
96. [PAUSE]
97. [SHOW: Back to Gab, or back to the hotel website]
98. Look, I built my hotel's website this way. I built other sites this way.
99. It works. It's not theoretical.
100. [BEAT]
101. And once you learn this, you can build as many sites as you want. For yourself, for your business, for your friends. Whatever.
102. [BEAT]
103. Alright. Enough talking about it.
104. Let's set up your tools and actually build this thing.
105. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Next: Module 2 — Setting Up Your Tools"]
106. I'll see you in the next one.
