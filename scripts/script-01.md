**Duration:** ~4 minutes | **Format:** Audio only

## INTRO — WHO I AM AND WHY YOU SHOULD LISTEN

1. Hey, what's up. I'm Gab.
2. I run a hotel in Quebec — over 60 rooms, restaurant, the whole thing.
3. [BEAT]
4. And the websites for my businesses? I built them myself.
5. No developer. No agency. No monthly fees.
6. [BEAT]
7. And I'm not a tech person. I don't have a computer science degree.
8. I just figured out a way to do this that's honestly kind of unfair.
9. [BEAT]
10. And that's what I'm gonna teach you.

## THE END RESULT — WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

11. So by the end of this course, you're gonna have a real website. Live on the internet. With your own URL.
12. Multiple pages. Clean design. Looks like you paid someone two grand for it.
13. [BEAT]
14. And it works on phones too. Perfectly.
15. [BEAT]
16. This isn't some janky template. This is a proper site.
17. And the best part? It costs you zero dollars a month to keep it live.
18. [PAUSE]
19. Zero.

## WHY NOT WIX / SQUARESPACE / WORDPRESS

20. Now, I know what you're thinking. "Gab, why wouldn't I just use Wix or Squarespace?"
21. And look — those are fine tools. I'm not gonna trash them.
22. But here's what nobody tells you.
23. [BEAT]
24. Wix starts at like sixteen bucks a month. Squarespace is similar.
25. That's almost two hundred dollars a year. Just to keep your site online.
26. WordPress? You need hosting. You need to deal with plugins. Updates. Security patches.
27. It's a part-time job.
28. [BEAT]
29. What I'm gonna show you costs zero per month. Not "free tier with ads." Actually zero.
30. It loads faster. You own every piece of it. And once it's up, there's nothing to maintain.
31. No updates to install. No plugins to break. No subscription to cancel.
32. [BEAT]
33. You just... have a website. That works.

## THE TWO TOOLS — CLAUDE CODE + GITHUB PAGES

34. Okay so here's how this works. Two tools. That's it.
35. [BEAT]
36. Tool number one: Claude Code.
37. Claude Code is an AI that lives in your terminal.
38. You know the terminal? That black screen with the blinking cursor that looks like a hacker movie?
39. [BEAT]
40. Yeah, that. Don't worry, it's not scary. I promise.
41. You just describe what you want in plain English.
42. Like, "Build me a homepage with a hero section and a contact form."
43. And it writes the code. Real code. Production-ready code.
44. You don't need to understand the code. You just need to describe what you want.
45. That's it. That's the whole skill.
46. [BEAT]
47. Tool number two: GitHub Pages.
48. GitHub is where developers store their code. You've probably heard of it.
49. GitHub Pages is a free feature that takes your code and turns it into a live website.
50. You put your files there, and boom — live website. Free hosting. Free URL. Free everything.
51. [BEAT]
52. So the workflow is simple. You talk to Claude Code. It writes your site. You push it to GitHub. GitHub makes it live.
53. That's the whole course.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED

54. Alright, let's talk about what you need to get started.
55. A computer. Mac or Windows, doesn't matter. If it's from the last ten years, you're fine.
56. An internet connection. Obviously.
57. About two hours of your time. Maybe less if you're quick.
58. An Anthropic account. That's the company behind Claude Code. We'll set that up in the next module.
59. And a GitHub account. Also free. Also setting that up next.
60. [BEAT]
61. That's it. Five things. You probably already have three of them.

## WHAT YOU'LL HAVE BY THE END

62. So let me tell you exactly what you'll walk away with.
63. A multi-page website. Not just one page — a real site with a homepage, an about page, whatever you need.
64. Professional design. Clean. Modern. The kind of thing that makes people take you seriously.
65. Fully mobile responsive. Looks perfect on a phone, a tablet, a giant monitor. Everything.
66. A live URL you can share with anyone. Put it on your business card. Send it to your mom. It's real.
67. [BEAT]
68. Your URL will be something like yourname.github.io. And if you want a custom domain later, like yourname.com, you can do that too.
69. [PAUSE]
70. Look, I built my hotel's website this way. I built other sites this way.
71. It works. It's not theoretical.
72. [BEAT]
73. And once you learn this, you can build as many sites as you want. For yourself, for your business, for your friends. Whatever.
74. [BEAT]
75. Alright. Enough talking about it.
76. Let's set up your tools and actually build this thing.
77. I'll see you in the next one.
