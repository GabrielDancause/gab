## INTRO — MAKE IT YOURS

2. Okay, so you've got a website.
3. It looks good. It works. It's real.
4. [BEAT]
5. But right now it looks like Claude's website. Not yours.
6. [PAUSE]
7. This module is where that changes.
8. We're gonna go through colors, fonts, images, layout, spacing, mobile — all of it.
9. [BEAT]
10. By the end, this thing is gonna feel like you hired a designer.
12. Let's get into it.

---

## COLORS — SETTING THE MOOD

14. First up. Colors.
15. Colors are the fastest way to change the entire mood of a site.
16. [BEAT]
17. Now you've got two ways to do this.
19. Option A: you already know the exact colors you want.
20. Maybe you've got brand colors. Maybe your logo uses a specific blue.
21. In that case, you give Claude the hex codes.
24. [BEAT]
25. Hex codes are those six-character codes with the hashtag in front. You can find them on any color picker.
27. Just Google "color picker." Pick a color. Copy the code. Done.
28. [BEAT]
30. But option B is honestly more fun.
31. Just describe the vibe.
32. [BEAT]
34. 
36. [PAUSE]
38. Look at that. Totally different site. Same content. Completely different energy.
39. [BEAT]
40. You can say things like "warm bakery," "tech startup," "beachy and relaxed," "dark and moody."
41. Claude gets vibes. Use that.
42. [PAUSE]
44. One rule though. Stick to three or four colors max.
45. One main color. One accent color. One or two neutrals for background and text.
46. [BEAT]
47. More than that and your site starts looking like a box of crayons.
48. Keep it simple. Simple looks expensive.

## FONTS — GIVING IT PERSONALITY

50. Next up. Fonts.
51. Fonts are like the voice of your website. They set the tone before anyone reads a word.
52. [BEAT]
53. The best free fonts live on Google Fonts. It's a library. Hundreds of options. All free.
55. And the good news? Claude knows all of them.
56. [BEAT]
57. So you can be specific.
59. 
61. [PAUSE]
63. See the difference? Playfair Display gives you that elegant, editorial feel. And Lato is clean and readable for the body.
64. [BEAT]
65. Here are some combos that almost always look good.
68. Playfair Display plus Lato. Classic elegance. Great for restaurants, hotels, boutiques.
70. Montserrat plus Open Sans. Clean and modern. Great for startups, agencies, portfolios.
72. Poppins plus Inter. Friendly and approachable. Great for personal brands, studios, shops.
74. Cormorant Garamond plus Raleway. Refined luxury. Think spas, jewelers, high-end anything.
75. [BEAT]
76. Or honestly? Just let Claude pick.
78. 
80. It'll pick something good. You can always swap it later.
81. [BEAT]
82. The point is — don't overthink fonts. Pick a combo, try it, and move on.

## IMAGES — MAKING IT REAL

84. Okay, this is a big one. Images.
85. [BEAT]
86. Right now, your site might have placeholder content or no images at all.
87. Real images are what take a site from "looks like a template" to "looks like a real business."
88. [PAUSE]
89. So here's how to do it.
91. Step one. Create an images folder inside your project.
92. 
93. 
94. [BEAT]
95. Step two. Drag your photos into that folder.
97. Your logo. Product photos. A photo of your space. Headshots. Whatever you've got.
98. [BEAT]
99. Step three. Tell Claude to use them.
101. 
103. [PAUSE]
105. Now it's looking real. That's a real bakery website now.
106. [BEAT]
108. Quick note on image sizes. This matters.
110. Hero images — the big background ones — should be about 1920 pixels wide. And try to keep them under 500 kilobytes.
112. Regular content images — like product photos — around 800 pixels wide, under 200 kilobytes.
113. [BEAT]
114. Why does this matter? Because big images make your site slow. And slow sites make people leave.
116. If your images are too big, go to squoosh.app. It's free. Made by Google.
117. Drag your image in, squish it down, download the smaller version.
118. Takes ten seconds.
119. [BEAT]
121. And hey — if you don't have images yet? That's fine.
122. You can ask Claude to use placeholders while you figure it out.
124. 
126. See? Now you've got something to look at while you take your product photos.
127. [BEAT]
128. No excuses. You can always swap them later.

## LAYOUT — REARRANGING THE PIECES

130. Alright. Layout. This is where you decide how things are arranged on the page.
131. [BEAT]
132. Maybe you want three cards side by side instead of stacked.
134. 
136. [BEAT]
137. Maybe you want the about section to be side-by-side — image on the left, text on the right.
139. 
141. [BEAT]
142. Maybe you want a photo carousel for your products instead of a grid.
144. 
146. [BEAT]
147. The point is — you don't need to know what a "CSS grid" or a "flexbox" is.
148. You just describe how you want things arranged. Claude handles the how.
149. [PAUSE]
150. Side by side. Stacked. Grid. Carousel. Overlapping. Full width. Centered.
151. Just say it.

## SPACING AND SIZING — THE SECRET TO LOOKING PRO

153. Okay this one is subtle but it makes a huge difference.
154. Spacing.
155. [BEAT]
156. The difference between a site that looks amateur and a site that looks professional?
157. Ninety percent of the time, it's spacing.
158. [PAUSE]
160. When things are too close together, it feels cramped. Cheap. Cluttered.
162. When things have room to breathe, it feels clean. Expensive. Intentional.
163. [BEAT]
165. Here's my golden rule: when in doubt, add more white space.
166. Seriously. Almost every website needs more space, not less.
167. [BEAT]
169. 
171. See that? Same content. But it feels more premium.
172. [BEAT]
173. You can also tweak font sizes.
175. 
177. [BEAT]
178. These small changes add up fast. Don't skip this step.

## MOBILE — MAKING SURE IT WORKS ON PHONES

180. Your site looks great on desktop. But you know where most people are gonna see it?
181. [BEAT]
183. Their phone.
184. [BEAT]
185. More than half of all web traffic is mobile. So your site has to look good small.
186. [PAUSE]
187. If you included "make it mobile responsive" in your first prompt, Claude already did a lot of the work.
188. But let's check it.
190. Here's the trick. In Chrome, right-click anywhere on the page and click "Inspect."
191. [RIGHT-CLICK → click Inspect]
193. Now click this little icon up here. The one that looks like a phone and a tablet.
194. [CLICK the device toggle icon in DevTools]
196. [BEAT]
197. Now you can see exactly what your site looks like on a phone.
198. 
199. [PAUSE]
200. Check a few things.
203. Is there a hamburger menu? Does it open and close?
204. [CLICK the hamburger menu to test it]
206. Are the grid items stacking vertically? Three columns on desktop should become one column on mobile.
208. Is the text readable? Not too small?
210. Is anything going off the edge of the screen? Horizontal scrolling is the enemy.
211. [BEAT]
212. If anything looks off, just tell Claude.
214. 
216. [BEAT]
218. 
220. [BEAT]
222. 
224. [BEAT]
225. Always check mobile. Always. It takes thirty seconds and it makes a massive difference.

## BONUS — DARK MODE TOGGLE

227. Okay, bonus round. This one's just fun.
228. [BEAT]
229. You want a dark mode toggle? One prompt.
231. 
233. [PAUSE]
235. See the toggle? Let's click it.
236. [CLICK the dark mode toggle]
238. [BEAT]
239. That's cool, right? And it remembers your choice. Refresh the page.
240. [REFRESH the page]
242. Still dark. It saved the preference.
243. [BEAT]
244. One prompt. That would've taken a developer an hour to code.
245. [CLICK toggle back to light mode]
246. Alright, back to light mode. Let's keep going.

## COMMON DESIGN PROMPTS — YOUR CHEAT SHEET

248. Before we wrap up, I wanna give you a cheat sheet.
249. These are prompts you can copy and paste whenever you need them.
250. [BEAT]
251. I'm gonna go through these quick. You don't need to memorize them. They'll be in the course resources.
252. [PAUSE]
255. Hero section: "Make the hero section full screen with a background image, a large headline, a subtitle, and a call-to-action button centered in the middle."
256. [BEAT]
258. Buttons: "Style all buttons with rounded corners, a bold color, and a smooth hover effect that slightly darkens the button and lifts it with a shadow."
259. [BEAT]
261. Cards: "Display the services as cards with a subtle shadow, rounded corners, and a hover effect that lifts the card up slightly."
262. [BEAT]
264. Sticky nav: "Make the navigation bar stick to the top of the page when scrolling and add a slight shadow underneath it."
265. [BEAT]
267. Smooth scroll: "Add smooth scrolling so when someone clicks a navigation link, the page glides to that section instead of jumping."
268. [BEAT]
270. Section backgrounds: "Alternate the background colors of each section — white, then a light gray, then white, then light gray — to create visual separation."
271. [BEAT]
273. Social icons: "Add social media icons in the footer for Instagram, Facebook, and email using Font Awesome or SVG icons."
274. [BEAT]
276. Back to top: "Add a 'back to top' button that appears when the user scrolls down and smoothly scrolls back to the top when clicked."
277. [BEAT]
279. Loading animation: "Add a subtle fade-in animation to the page so the content fades in smoothly when the page loads."
280. [BEAT]
282. Gradient background: "Add a soft gradient background to the hero section — going from a deep navy on the left to a rich teal on the right."
283. [BEAT]
285. Image gallery: "Create a masonry-style image gallery section with photos that arrange themselves in an elegant, Pinterest-like grid."
286. [BEAT]
288. Embedded map: "Add a Google Maps embed showing the business location in the contact section."
289. [BEAT]
291. Scroll animations: "Add scroll-triggered animations so each section fades in and slides up slightly as the user scrolls to it."
292. [BEAT]
294. Favicon: "Create a simple favicon for the site using the first letter of the business name and add it to the HTML."
295. [PAUSE]
296. That's the cheat sheet. Bookmark it. Come back to it whenever you're building.

## WHEN TO STOP TWEAKING

298. Last thing. And I need you to hear me on this one.
299. [BEAT]
301. You need to know when to stop.
302. [PAUSE]
303. Here's what happens. You start tweaking. And it feels great.
304. You change a color. You adjust the spacing. You try a new font.
305. [BEAT]
306. And then three hours later you're still adjusting the border radius on a button that nobody is ever gonna notice.
307. [BEAT]
308. I've been there. We've all been there.
309. [PAUSE]
311. So here's my rule. Good enough is good enough.
312. [BEAT]
313. Your site doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be live.
314. A live, good website beats a perfect website that's still on your laptop.
315. [BEAT]
317. Ship at 90 percent.
318. Get it to a point where you're proud of it. Where you'd show it to someone. And then stop.
319. [BEAT]
320. You can always come back and tweak later. That's the beauty of this workflow.
321. It takes thirty seconds to make a change.
322. [PAUSE]
323. But for now? Ship it. Get it live. Show the world.
324. [BEAT]
325. Perfection is the enemy of done. And done is what gets you clients, customers, and credibility.

## OUTRO — WHAT'S NEXT

327. Look at what you've got now.
328. 
329. Custom colors. Custom fonts. Real images. Solid layout. Looks great on mobile.
330. [BEAT]
331. This is a professional website. Built with words. No code.
332. [PAUSE]
333. You should feel good about this. Seriously.
334. [BEAT]
335. In the next module, we're gonna take this from your laptop and put it on the internet.
336. A real URL. A live site. For free.
338. [BEAT]
339. That's when it gets really real.
340. See you in the next one.
