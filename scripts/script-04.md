## INTRO — MAKE IT YOURS

1. [SHOW: The Golden Crust Bakery site from Module 3]
2. Okay, so you've got a website.
3. It looks good. It works. It's real.
4. [BEAT]
5. But right now it looks like Claude's website. Not yours.
6. [PAUSE]
7. This module is where that changes.
8. We're gonna go through colors, fonts, images, layout, spacing, mobile — all of it.
9. [BEAT]
10. By the end, this thing is gonna feel like you hired a designer.
11. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Make it yours."]
12. Let's get into it.

## COLORS — SETTING THE MOOD

13. [SHOW: The bakery site, focusing on the current color scheme]
14. First up. Colors.
15. Colors are the fastest way to change the entire mood of a site.
16. [BEAT]
17. Now you've got two ways to do this.
18. [SHOW: Option A on screen — "Hex codes"]
19. Option A: you already know the exact colors you want.
20. Maybe you've got brand colors. Maybe your logo uses a specific blue.
21. In that case, you give Claude the hex codes.
22. [SHOW: Example prompt being typed]
23. [TYPE: Change the primary color to #2D5F3E, the secondary to #F5E6C8, and the accent color to #C1553B]
24. [BEAT]
25. Hex codes are those six-character codes with the hashtag in front. You can find them on any color picker.
26. [SHOW: Quick flash — Google "color picker" showing the tool]
27. Just Google "color picker." Pick a color. Copy the code. Done.
28. [BEAT]
29. [SHOW: Option B on screen — "Describe the vibe"]
30. But option B is honestly more fun.
31. Just describe the vibe.
32. [BEAT]
33. [TYPE: Change the color scheme to feel like a luxury hotel — dark charcoal backgrounds, gold accents, cream text, very elegant and high-end]
34. [HIT ENTER]
35. [SHOW: Claude Code processing the change]
36. [PAUSE]
37. [SHOW: Refresh browser — new luxury color scheme]
38. Look at that. Totally different site. Same content. Completely different energy.
39. [BEAT]
40. You can say things like "warm bakery," "tech startup," "beachy and relaxed," "dark and moody."
41. Claude gets vibes. Use that.
42. [PAUSE]
43. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Stick to 3-4 colors max"]
44. One rule though. Stick to three or four colors max.
45. One main color. One accent color. One or two neutrals for background and text.
46. [BEAT]
47. More than that and your site starts looking like a box of crayons.
48. Keep it simple. Simple looks expensive.

## FONTS — GIVING IT PERSONALITY

49. [SHOW: The bakery site, focusing on the current typography]
50. Next up. Fonts.
51. Fonts are like the voice of your website. They set the tone before anyone reads a word.
52. [BEAT]
53. The best free fonts live on Google Fonts. It's a library. Hundreds of options. All free.
54. [SHOW: Quick flash — Google Fonts website, fonts.google.com]
55. And the good news? Claude knows all of them.
56. [BEAT]
57. So you can be specific.
58. [TYPE: Use Playfair Display for all headings and Lato for body text. Load them from Google Fonts.]
59. [HIT ENTER]
60. [SHOW: Claude Code processing]
61. [PAUSE]
62. [SHOW: Refresh browser — new fonts applied]
63. See the difference? Playfair Display gives you that elegant, editorial feel. And Lato is clean and readable for the body.
64. [BEAT]
65. Here are some combos that almost always look good.
66. [SHOW: List on screen, appearing one at a time]
67. [SHOW: Combo 1 — "Playfair Display + Lato — Classic elegance"]
68. Playfair Display plus Lato. Classic elegance. Great for restaurants, hotels, boutiques.
69. [SHOW: Combo 2 — "Montserrat + Open Sans — Clean and modern"]
70. Montserrat plus Open Sans. Clean and modern. Great for startups, agencies, portfolios.
71. [SHOW: Combo 3 — "Poppins + Inter — Friendly and approachable"]
72. Poppins plus Inter. Friendly and approachable. Great for personal brands, studios, shops.
73. [SHOW: Combo 4 — "Cormorant Garamond + Raleway — Refined luxury"]
74. Cormorant Garamond plus Raleway. Refined luxury. Think spas, jewelers, high-end anything.
75. [BEAT]
76. Or honestly? Just let Claude pick.
77. [TYPE: Choose a font combination that feels warm, professional, and inviting for a bakery website. Use Google Fonts.]
78. [HIT ENTER]
79. [SHOW: Result]
80. It'll pick something good. You can always swap it later.
81. [BEAT]
82. The point is — don't overthink fonts. Pick a combo, try it, and move on.

## IMAGES — MAKING IT REAL

83. [SHOW: The bakery site — currently with no real images]
84. Okay, this is a big one. Images.
85. [BEAT]
86. Right now, your site might have placeholder content or no images at all.
87. Real images are what take a site from "looks like a template" to "looks like a real business."
88. [PAUSE]
89. So here's how to do it.
90. [SHOW: Finder/File Explorer window]
91. Step one. Create an images folder inside your project.
92. [TYPE in terminal: mkdir images]
93. [HIT ENTER]
94. [BEAT]
95. Step two. Drag your photos into that folder.
96. [SHOW: Dragging image files into the images folder in Finder]
97. Your logo. Product photos. A photo of your space. Headshots. Whatever you've got.
98. [BEAT]
99. Step three. Tell Claude to use them.
100. [TYPE: I've added photos to the images folder. Use hero-bg.jpg as the hero background image, croissant.jpg for the first menu item, sourdough.jpg for the second, and pain-au-chocolat.jpg for the third.]
101. [HIT ENTER]
102. [SHOW: Claude Code processing]
103. [PAUSE]
104. [SHOW: Refresh browser — real images on the site]
105. Now it's looking real. That's a real bakery website now.
106. [BEAT]
107. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Image Size Guidelines"]
108. Quick note on image sizes. This matters.
109. [SHOW: Guideline 1 — "Hero images: 1920px wide, under 500KB"]
110. Hero images — the big background ones — should be about 1920 pixels wide. And try to keep them under 500 kilobytes.
111. [SHOW: Guideline 2 — "Content images: 800px wide, under 200KB"]
112. Regular content images — like product photos — around 800 pixels wide, under 200 kilobytes.
113. [BEAT]
114. Why does this matter? Because big images make your site slow. And slow sites make people leave.
115. [SHOW: squoosh.app in the browser]
116. If your images are too big, go to squoosh.app. It's free. Made by Google.
117. Drag your image in, squish it down, download the smaller version.
118. Takes ten seconds.
119. [BEAT]
120. [SHOW: Back to the site]
121. And hey — if you don't have images yet? That's fine.
122. You can ask Claude to use placeholders while you figure it out.
123. [TYPE: Use placeholder images from unsplash for now — bakery themed photos. I'll replace them with my own later.]
124. [HIT ENTER]
125. [SHOW: Result with placeholder images]
126. See? Now you've got something to look at while you take your product photos.
127. [BEAT]
128. No excuses. You can always swap them later.

## LAYOUT — REARRANGING THE PIECES

129. [SHOW: The bakery site, current layout]
130. Alright. Layout. This is where you decide how things are arranged on the page.
131. [BEAT]
132. Maybe you want three cards side by side instead of stacked.
133. [TYPE: Show the three signature items as cards in a three-column grid with images on top and descriptions below]
134. [HIT ENTER]
135. [SHOW: Result — three-column card layout]
136. [BEAT]
137. Maybe you want the about section to be side-by-side — image on the left, text on the right.
138. [TYPE: Make the about section a two-column layout with a photo of the bakery on the left side and the text on the right side]
139. [HIT ENTER]
140. [SHOW: Result — side-by-side about section]
141. [BEAT]
142. Maybe you want a photo carousel for your products instead of a grid.
143. [TYPE: Replace the menu items grid with a horizontal image carousel that auto-scrolls and has left/right arrow buttons]
144. [HIT ENTER]
145. [SHOW: Result — carousel]
146. [BEAT]
147. The point is — you don't need to know what a "CSS grid" or a "flexbox" is.
148. You just describe how you want things arranged. Claude handles the how.
149. [PAUSE]
150. Side by side. Stacked. Grid. Carousel. Overlapping. Full width. Centered.
151. Just say it.

## SPACING AND SIZING — THE SECRET TO LOOKING PRO

152. [SHOW: The bakery site]
153. Okay this one is subtle but it makes a huge difference.
154. Spacing.
155. [BEAT]
156. The difference between a site that looks amateur and a site that looks professional?
157. Ninety percent of the time, it's spacing.
158. [PAUSE]
159. [SHOW: Before — sections crammed together]
160. When things are too close together, it feels cramped. Cheap. Cluttered.
161. [SHOW: After — sections with generous white space]
162. When things have room to breathe, it feels clean. Expensive. Intentional.
163. [BEAT]
164. [SHOW: Text on screen — "When in doubt, add more white space."]
165. Here's my golden rule: when in doubt, add more white space.
166. Seriously. Almost every website needs more space, not less.
167. [BEAT]
168. [TYPE: Add more vertical padding between all sections — at least 80px top and bottom. Make everything feel more spacious and airy.]
169. [HIT ENTER]
170. [SHOW: Result — more breathing room]
171. See that? Same content. But it feels more premium.
172. [BEAT]
173. You can also tweak font sizes.
174. [TYPE: Make the main headline bigger — around 56px on desktop. Make the body text 18px for better readability. And bump the section headings up to 36px.]
175. [HIT ENTER]
176. [SHOW: Result — better typography sizing]
177. [BEAT]
178. These small changes add up fast. Don't skip this step.

## MOBILE — MAKING SURE IT WORKS ON PHONES

179. [SHOW: The bakery site on desktop, looking great]
180. Your site looks great on desktop. But you know where most people are gonna see it?
181. [BEAT]
182. [SHOW: Hold up a phone, or show a phone mockup]
183. Their phone.
184. [BEAT]
185. More than half of all web traffic is mobile. So your site has to look good small.
186. [PAUSE]
187. If you included "make it mobile responsive" in your first prompt, Claude already did a lot of the work.
188. But let's check it.
189. [SHOW: Chrome browser on the bakery site]
190. Here's the trick. In Chrome, right-click anywhere on the page and click "Inspect."
191. [RIGHT-CLICK → click Inspect]
192. [SHOW: Chrome DevTools opening]
193. Now click this little icon up here. The one that looks like a phone and a tablet.
194. [CLICK the device toggle icon in DevTools]
195. [SHOW: The site in mobile view inside Chrome DevTools]
196. [BEAT]
197. Now you can see exactly what your site looks like on a phone.
198. [SCROLL through the mobile version]
199. [PAUSE]
200. Check a few things.
201. [SHOW: Checklist on screen]
202. [SHOW: Check 1 — "Hamburger menu working?"]
203. Is there a hamburger menu? Does it open and close?
204. [CLICK the hamburger menu to test it]
205. [SHOW: Check 2 — "Grid stacking properly?"]
206. Are the grid items stacking vertically? Three columns on desktop should become one column on mobile.
207. [SHOW: Check 3 — "Text readable?"]
208. Is the text readable? Not too small?
209. [SHOW: Check 4 — "Nothing overflowing?"]
210. Is anything going off the edge of the screen? Horizontal scrolling is the enemy.
211. [BEAT]
212. If anything looks off, just tell Claude.
213. [TYPE: On mobile, the navigation menu is overlapping the hero text. Fix the hamburger menu so it opens as a full-screen overlay with large tap-friendly links.]
214. [HIT ENTER]
215. [SHOW: Result — fixed mobile menu]
216. [BEAT]
217. [TYPE: On mobile, the three-column grid isn't stacking. Make it stack into a single column on screens smaller than 768px.]
218. [HIT ENTER]
219. [SHOW: Result — proper stacking]
220. [BEAT]
221. [TYPE: The body text is too small on mobile. Bump it up to 16px minimum and make sure there's enough line height for easy reading.]
222. [HIT ENTER]
223. [SHOW: Result — better mobile text]
224. [BEAT]
225. Always check mobile. Always. It takes thirty seconds and it makes a massive difference.

## BONUS — DARK MODE TOGGLE

226. [SHOW: The bakery site, normal light mode]
227. Okay, bonus round. This one's just fun.
228. [BEAT]
229. You want a dark mode toggle? One prompt.
230. [TYPE: Add a dark mode toggle button in the top right corner of the navigation. When clicked, it should switch the entire site to a dark theme — dark background, light text, adjusted colors for readability. Save the user's preference so it persists on refresh.]
231. [HIT ENTER]
232. [SHOW: Claude Code processing]
233. [PAUSE]
234. [SHOW: Refresh browser — light mode with a toggle button visible]
235. See the toggle? Let's click it.
236. [CLICK the dark mode toggle]
237. [SHOW: Site switching to dark mode — smooth transition]
238. [BEAT]
239. That's cool, right? And it remembers your choice. Refresh the page.
240. [REFRESH the page]
241. [SHOW: Dark mode persists]
242. Still dark. It saved the preference.
243. [BEAT]
244. One prompt. That would've taken a developer an hour to code.
245. [CLICK toggle back to light mode]
246. Alright, back to light mode. Let's keep going.

## WHEN TO STOP TWEAKING

297. [SHOW: The bakery site, looking polished and complete]
298. Last thing. And I need you to hear me on this one.
299. [BEAT]
300. [SHOW: Text on screen — "When to stop."]
301. You need to know when to stop.
302. [PAUSE]
303. Here's what happens. You start tweaking. And it feels great.
304. You change a color. You adjust the spacing. You try a new font.
305. [BEAT]
306. And then three hours later you're still adjusting the border radius on a button that nobody is ever gonna notice.
307. [BEAT]
308. I've been there. We've all been there.
309. [PAUSE]
310. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Good enough is good enough."]
311. So here's my rule. Good enough is good enough.
312. [BEAT]
313. Your site doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be live.
314. A live, good website beats a perfect website that's still on your laptop.
315. [BEAT]
316. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Ship at 90%."]
317. Ship at 90 percent.
318. Get it to a point where you're proud of it. Where you'd show it to someone. And then stop.
319. [BEAT]
320. You can always come back and tweak later. That's the beauty of this workflow.
321. It takes thirty seconds to make a change.
322. [PAUSE]
323. But for now? Ship it. Get it live. Show the world.
324. [BEAT]
325. Perfection is the enemy of done. And done is what gets you clients, customers, and credibility.
