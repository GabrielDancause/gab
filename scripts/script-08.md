## INTRO — THIS IS IT

1. [SHOW: Browser open, GitHub repo page with all the files from Module 7]
2. This is it.
3. [BEAT]
4. This is the moment.
5. [PAUSE]
6. Everything you've done so far — setting up your tools, writing prompts, building pages, learning Git —
7. It was all for this.
8. [BEAT]
9. In the next two minutes, your website is going to be on the internet.
10. Not localhost. Not a preview. The real, actual internet.
11. [BEAT]
12. Anyone with the link will be able to see it.
13. Your mom. Your friends. Your customers. Anyone.
14. [BEAT]
15. And it's free. GitHub gives you this for free.
16. [PAUSE]
17. Let's do it.

## STEP 1 — GO TO YOUR REPO

18. [SHOW: GitHub repo page]
19. Okay. You should already be on your GitHub repo page.
20. If not, go to github.com, click your profile icon, go to "Your repositories," and click on your website repo.
21. [SHOW: Navigating — profile icon → Your repositories → clicking the repo]
22. [BEAT]
23. You should see all your files here. Your `index.html`, your CSS, your images. Everything we pushed in the last module.
24. [BEAT]
25. Good. Now.

---

## STEP 2 — OPEN SETTINGS

26. [SHOW: GitHub repo page, top navigation bar]
27. See the tabs at the top? Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions...
28. [BEAT]
29. All the way to the right. Settings.
30. [SHOW: Mouse moving to the Settings tab]
31. Click Settings.
32. [CLICK: Settings]
33. [SHOW: Repository settings page loading]
34. [BEAT]
35. Now look at the left sidebar.
36. [SHOW: Left sidebar of settings page]
37. Scroll down a little and you'll see "Pages."
38. [SHOW: Mouse hovering over "Pages" in the sidebar]
39. Click it.
40. [CLICK: Pages]
41. [SHOW: GitHub Pages settings page]
42. [BEAT]
43. This is where the magic happens.

---

## STEP 3 — CONFIGURE GITHUB PAGES

44. [SHOW: GitHub Pages settings — Source section]
45. Alright. You should see a section that says "Build and deployment."
46. [BEAT]
47. Under "Source," it should say "Deploy from a branch."
48. If it doesn't, click the dropdown and select that.
49. [SHOW: Source dropdown — selecting "Deploy from a branch"]
50. [BEAT]
51. Now. Under "Branch."
52. [SHOW: Branch dropdown, currently showing "None"]
53. Click the dropdown. Select "main."
54. [CLICK: Branch dropdown → select "main"]
55. [BEAT]
56. Next to it, there's a folder dropdown. Make sure it says `/ (root)`.
57. [SHOW: Folder dropdown — "/ (root)" selected]
58. That just means your website files are in the main folder, not buried inside a subfolder.
59. [BEAT]
60. Now click Save.
61. [SHOW: Mouse clicking the Save button]
62. [CLICK: Save]
63. [BEAT]
64. That's it. You just told GitHub, "Hey, take the code on my main branch and turn it into a website."
65. [BEAT]
66. Now we wait.

---

## STEP 4 — WAIT FOR THE BUILD

67. [SHOW: GitHub Pages settings page, maybe a brief banner saying settings were saved]
68. GitHub needs a minute or two to build your site.
69. [BEAT]
70. You wanna check if it's done? Click on the "Actions" tab up top.
71. [SHOW: Mouse clicking the Actions tab]
72. [CLICK: Actions tab]
73. [SHOW: Actions page with a workflow running — "pages build and deployment" with an orange dot or spinner]
74. [BEAT]
75. See that? It says "pages build and deployment." That orange dot means it's still working.
76. [BEAT]
77. Just wait. Give it a minute.
78. [BEAT]
79. [SHOW: Time passing — maybe a quick timelapse or a jump cut]
80. [SHOW: Actions page — the workflow now has a green checkmark]
81. [BEAT]
82. Green checkmark. That means it's done.
83. [BEAT]
84. Your website is live.

---

## STEP 5 — GET YOUR URL

85. [SHOW: Navigating back — Settings → Pages]
86. Go back to Settings. Click Pages again.
87. [CLICK: Settings → Pages]
88. [SHOW: GitHub Pages settings — now with a green box at the top showing the live URL]
89. [PAUSE]
90. Look at that.
91. [BEAT]
92. See that green box at the top?
93. [SHOW: Zoom in on the green box — "Your site is live at https://your-username.github.io/my-website/"]
94. That's your URL. That's your website. On the internet. Right now.
95. [BEAT]
96. Click it.
97. [CLICK: The URL in the green box]

---

## THE BIG MOMENT

98. [SHOW: New tab opening, the URL loading in the browser address bar]
99. [PAUSE — let it load]
100. [SHOW: The full website loading in the browser — the homepage, styled, with images, everything]
101. [LONG PAUSE — 3-4 seconds. Let this moment breathe.]
102. [BEAT]
103. There it is.
104. [BEAT]
105. That's your website. On the internet. You built that.
106. [PAUSE]
107. Not a developer. Not a designer. You.
108. [BEAT]
109. With your own words. With your own ideas. With a conversation.
110. [BEAT]
111. And anyone in the world can see it right now.
112. [PAUSE]
113. Take a second. Let that sink in.
114. [LONG PAUSE]

## TROUBLESHOOTING — IF SOMETHING'S OFF

115. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Quick Troubleshooting"]
116. Now. If things don't look perfect right away, don't panic.
117. [BEAT]
118. Here are the three most common issues.
119. [BEAT]
120. [SHOW: Issue 1 — "Site not showing at all"]
121. Number one. The site's not showing at all. You get a 404 or a blank page.
122. [BEAT]
123. First thing — go to the Actions tab. Is there a red X instead of a green checkmark?
124. [SHOW: Actions tab with a red X on the workflow]
125. If so, the build failed. Click on it to see the error.
126. [BEAT]
127. Most common reason? Your main HTML file isn't called `index.html`. It has to be exactly that. Not `home.html`. Not `main.html`. `index.html`.
128. [BEAT]
129. [SHOW: Issue 2 — "404 Page Not Found"]
130. Number two. 404 Page Not Found.
131. [BEAT]
132. This usually means your `index.html` isn't in the root of your repo. It's buried inside a folder.
133. Your file structure should look like this.
134. [SHOW: File structure — index.html at the top level, not inside a subfolder]
135. `index.html` should be right at the top level. Not inside a `src` folder. Not inside a `public` folder. Right there at the root.
136. [BEAT]
137. If it's in the wrong place, tell Claude, "Move index.html to the root of my project," commit, and push again.
138. [BEAT]
139. Also — sometimes it just needs more time. If you just pushed, wait another minute and refresh.
140. [BEAT]
141. [SHOW: Issue 3 — "CSS or images not loading"]
142. Number three. The site loads, but the CSS is broken or images aren't showing up.
143. [BEAT]
144. This is almost always a file path issue.
145. [BEAT]
146. Your CSS might be linked as `/styles.css` when it should be `styles.css` or `./styles.css`.
147. Same with images. If the path is wrong, the browser can't find the file.
148. [BEAT]
149. The fix? Tell Claude.
150. [SHOW: Claude Code prompt]
151. [TYPE on screen: My site is live on GitHub Pages but the CSS and images aren't loading. Fix the file paths.]
152. "My site is live on GitHub Pages but the CSS and images aren't loading. Fix the file paths."
153. [BEAT]
154. Claude will look at your HTML, fix every path, and you just commit and push again.
155. [BEAT]
156. Easy.

## CELEBRATE — YOU DID IT

157. [SHOW: The live website in the browser, full and beautiful]
158. But listen.
159. [BEAT]
160. If your site is up and it looks good?
161. [BEAT]
162. That's a big deal.
163. [PAUSE]
164. I don't care if it's a one-page bakery site. I don't care if it's simple.
165. You just built and deployed a website. From scratch. Without writing code.
166. [BEAT]
167. Most people pay someone thousands of dollars for this.
168. You did it yourself. With a conversation.
169. [PAUSE]
170. So here's what I want you to do right now.
171. [BEAT]
172. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Copy that URL."]
173. Copy that URL.
174. [BEAT]
175. [SHOW: Text on screen — "Text it to someone."]
176. And text it to someone.
177. [BEAT]
178. Your friend. Your partner. Your mom. Your business partner. Someone.
179. [BEAT]
180. Send them the link and say, "I built this."
181. [PAUSE]
182. Because you did.
183. [BEAT]
184. And this is just the beginning.
185. [BEAT]
186. In the next modules, we're gonna talk about custom domains, updating your site, and making it even better.
187. [BEAT]
188. But for right now? Go celebrate. You earned it.
189. [PAUSE]
190. I'll see you in the next one.
191. [SHOW: End screen]
